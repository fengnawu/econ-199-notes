### Question 1: 
Suppose there are 90 consumers in the market with two goods $x$ and $y$. There are two types of individuals A and B. 30 of the consumers are type A and the 60 of them are type B. Type A consumers have a utility function of $u(x,y) = x^{1/2}y^{1/2}$ and each of them has an income of $m_A$. Type B consumers have a utility function of $u(x,y) = x^{1/3}y^{2/3}$ and each of them has an income of $m_B$. 

1. Find the individual demand for type A for good $x$ and $y$ as a function of $m_A, p_x$, and $p_y$. 
3. Find the individual demand for type B for good $x$ and $y$ as a function of $m_B, p_x$, and $p_y$. 
2. Find the market demand for good $x$ as a function of incomes and prices.
2. Find the market demand for good $y$ as a function of incomes and prices.
5. Suppose price of good $x$ is 1 and the price good $y$ is 2. Further suppose $m_A = 10$ and $m_B = 30$. Find the market demand for good $x$ and good $y$ at the given prices and incomes. 

### Solutions
1. From the general formula of Cobb-Douglas demand function: $$ \begin{align}
x_A(p_x, p_y, m_A) = \\frac{a}{a+b} \\frac{m_A}{p_x} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m_A}{p_x} \\\\
y_A(p_x, p_y, m_A) = \\frac{b}{a+b} \\frac{m_A}{p_y} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m_A}{p_y} \\\\
\end{align}  $$ 

2. $$ \begin{align}
x_B(p_x, p_y, m_B) = \\frac{a}{a+b} \\frac{m_B}{p_x} = \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{m_B}{p_x} \\\\
y_B(p_x, p_y, m_B) = \\frac{b}{a+b} \\frac{m_B}{p_y} = \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{m_B}{p_y} \\\\
\end{align}  $$ 

3. $$ \begin{align}
X(p_x, p_y, m_A, m_B) = 30 \times x_A(p_x, p_y, m_A) + 60 \times x_B(p_x, p_y, m_B) = 15 \\frac{m_A}{p_x} +20 \\frac{m_B}{p_x} 
\end{align}  $$ 

4. $$ \begin{align}
Y(p_x, p_y, m_A, m_B) = 30 \times y_A(p_x, p_y, m_A) + 60 \times y_B(p_x, p_y, m_B) = 15 \\frac{m_A}{p_y} +40 \\frac{m_B}{p_y} 
\end{align}  $$ 

5. $$ \begin{align}
X(p_x, p_y, m) = 15 \\frac{10}{1} + 20 \\frac{30}{1} =  150 + 600 = 750 \\\\
Y(p_x, p_y, m) = 15 \\frac{10}{2} + 40 \\frac{30}{2} =  75 + 600 = 675
\end{align}  $$ 



### Question 2: 
Suppose that daily demand for breakfast sandwiches at a local store is given by the following:$Q^{d}=500-100P$

1. What is the formula for the own price elasticity of demand as a function of price? In other words, please provide a formula for the price elasticity of demand where the only variable on the right-hand-side is price.

2. What is the price elasticity of demand for breakfast sandwiches at the price of $0.5, 1, 2, 3,$ and $4$, respectively:

3. As you can see, the price elasticity is different depending on the values of prices at which it is evaluated. For what price is the own price elasticity of demand one? In other words, for what price is demand unit elastic? 

4. For what range of prices is demand elastic $\left(\left|\varepsilon_{Q^{d},P}\right|>1\right)$? For what range of prices is demand inelastic $\left(\left|\varepsilon_{Q^{d},P}\right|<1\right)$? 


### Solutions:
1. $ \varepsilon_{Q^{d},P}=\\frac{\Delta Q^{d}}{\Delta P}\cdot\\frac{P}{Q^{d}}=-100\cdot\\frac{P}{500-100P}=\\frac{-100P}{500-100P} $  
2. Plug different levels of $P$'s into the formula in Q2.1. The answers are, in absolute value,  $0.11, 0.25, 0.67, 1.5,$ and $4$, respectively.  
3. $$\begin{align}
1&=\\frac{100P}{500-100P} \\\\
500-100P&=100P \\\\ 
200P&=500 \\\\
P&=2.5
\end{align}$$

4. For the given demand function, demand becomes more elastic as the price rises. Therefore, demand is elastic for $P>2.50$. Conversely, for $0 \leq P<2.50$, it is inelastic. Note that elasticity is zero for $P=0$.


### Question 3:
Suppose we have a market with 100 individuals with preferences over two goods, $x$ and $y$.

1. Consider that all 100 individuals have the utility function $U=x^{2/3}y^{1/3}$ and that each individual has the same income and is subject to the same prices. Calculate the market demand for $x$ as a function of income and prices.

2. Find the own price elasticity of demand for good $x$. Is the elasticity constant or is it changing at different values of $P_x$? 

3. Suppose now that we know $m=90, P_{x}=2,$ and $P_{y}=1$. What is the market demand for $x$? This should be a number.

3. Consider now that 50 individuals $($type A$)$ have the utility function $U=x^{2/3}y^{1/3}$ and the other 50 $($type B$)$have the utility function $U=x^{1/3}y^{2/3}$. Each individual still has the same income and is subject to the same prices. Calculate the market demand for $x$ as a function of income and prices.

4. Suppose now that we know $m=90, P_{x}=2$, and $P_{y}=1$. What is the market demand for $x$? This should be a number.

### Solutions
1. $x	=	\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}$ using the Cobb-Douglas demand formula also written in the Q1 above. This provides us with the individual demand. Since everyone is the same, market demand is just: $Q_{x}^{d}=\sum_{i=1}^{100}x_{i}=100 \times x=\\frac{200}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}$

2. $\\frac{\partial Q^d_{x}}{\partial P_x} \\frac{P_x}{Q^d_x} = -\\frac{200}{3} m (\\frac{1}{P^2_x}) \Big(\\frac{P_x}{\\frac{200}{3} \\frac{m}{P_x}} \Big) = -1$.
Cobb-Douglas preferences features a constant elasticity of demand. More generally, any demand function that has a form of $Q = Ap^{\varepsilon}$ has a constant elasticity of demand. 

2. We use the formula from above: $Q_{x}^{d}=\\frac{200}{3}\times\\frac{90}{2}=3,000$

3. We already know type A individuals will have the individual demand: $x_{A}=\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}$. Type B individuals will have the individual demand: $x_B = \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}$. Market demand, therefore, is: $Q_{x}^{d}=\sum_{i=1}^{100}x_{i}=50\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}\right)+50\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}\right)=\left(100+50\right)\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}\right)=50\\frac{m}{P_{x}}$

4. Using the formula from above, $Q_{x}^{d}=50\times\\frac{90}{2}=2,250$



### Question 4:
Consider the [smoothie example](http://dining.queensu.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Recipe-Smoothie.jpg) given in class: 

1. Write down the production function of Tutti Frutti Smoothie example given in class. Make sure that all ingredients are expressed in Oz.  

2. Identify the returns to scale of this production function. Is it decreasing, increasing, or constant returns to scale?  


### Solutions
1. $Q=\min\\{\\frac{mango}{3.75}\,,\\frac{banana}{2.5}\,,\\frac{strawberry}{3.75}\,,\\frac{appleJuice}{10}\\} $ 
A common mistake is to give this function: $$
Q=\min \\{3.75mango\,,2.5banana\,,3.75strawberry\,,10AppleJuice \\}.
$$ 
To see why this one is wrong plug in the exact amount of ingredients for one glass of smoothie $($3.75 of mango, 2.5 banana, etc$)$ and realize this function does not give you back 1 glass of smoothie!  

2. First, remember and undesrstand this mathematical fact: If you have $x < z$ and $ \lambda>0 $, then $\lambda x < \lambda z $. That is, the order is preserved, always! $($try with some numbers$)$

Therefore, if $x$ and $z$ are inputs of a min production function $Q(x,z)=\min\\{ax\,,\,bz\\}$, we have:
$Q(\lambda x,\lambda z)=\min\\{a\,\lambda x\,,\,b\,\lambda z\\}=\lambda\min\\{ax\,,\,bz\\}=\lambda Q(x,z)$
The same logic applies if we have more inputs like in our case. Hence:
$$
\begin{align}
&\min\\{\\frac{{\color{blue}\lambda}mango}{3.75}\,,\\frac{{\color{blue}\lambda}banana}{2.5}\,,\\frac{{\color{blue}\lambda}strawberry}{3.75}\,,\\frac{{\color{blue}\lambda}appleJuice}{10}\\} \\\\
&={\color{blue}\lambda}*\min\\{\\frac{mango}{3.75}\,,\\frac{banana}{2.5}\,,\\frac{strawberry}{3.75}\,,\\frac{appleJuice}{10}\\}
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, we have constant returns to scale. In general, any production function of this form $\min\\{ax\,,\,by\,,\,cz\,,...,\,dw\\}$ where $x, y, z,..., w$ are the inputs and $a, b, c ... d$ are fixed coefficients will yield constant retursn to scale.  


### Question 5:
Consider the following production function that depends only on labor:$Q=5L^{1/2}$

1. Write a combination of input and output that are technically efficient. In other words, for what level of $L$ and $Q$, is the technology efficient?

2. Write a combination of input and output that are technically inefficient. In other words, for what level of $L$ and $Q$, is the technology inefficient?

3. Write a combination of input and output that are technically unattainable. In other words, for what level of $L$ and $Q$, is the technology unattainable?

### Solutions
1. Anything such that $Q=5L^{1/2}$. An example would be $\left(L=4,Q=10\right)$.  

2. Anything such that $Q<5L^{1/2}$. An example would be $\left(L=4,Q=8\right)$.  

3. Anything such that $Q>5L^{1/2}$. An example would be $\left(L=4,Q=12\right)$.  


### Question 6:
Consider the following production function that depends only on labor:$Q=L+10L^{2}-L^{3}$

1. Compute the $APL$ $($average product of labor$)$.

2. Compute the $MPL$ $($marginal product of labor$)$.

3. What is the value of $L^{\*}$ at which $APL$ is the highest? 

4. For $L > L^{\*}$, which one is bigger, $APL$ or $MPL$? How about when $L < L^{\*}$ and $L = L^{\*}$?

5. Draw $APL$ and $MPL$ on the y-axis as a function of $L$ on the x-axis. Label the point of the intersection of $APL$ and $MPL$.

### Solutions
1. $APL=\\frac{Q}{L}=1+10L-L^{2}$

2. $MPL=\\frac{\partial Q}{\partial L}=1+20L-3L^{2}$  

3. $\\frac{\partial APL}{\partial L} = 10 - 2L$ By setting it equal to zero, we get $L^{\*} = 5$.  

4. $MPL < APL$ for $L>5$.  As the marginal product is lower than the average product, $APL$ decreases as $L$ increases. $MPL > APL$ for $L<5$. As the marginal product is higher than the average product, $APL$ increases as $L$ increases.  $APL = MPL$ when $L=5$.

### Question 7:
Consider the following production function: $Q=AL^{a}K^{b}$. Assume $A>0$. Further assume $0<a<1$, and $0<b<1$.

1. What is the Marginal Product of Labor $(MP_{L})$? Is it diminishing as $L$ increases? What is the Marginal Product of Capital $(MP_{K})$? Is it diminishing as $K$ increases?

2. What is the Average Product of Labor $(AP_{L})$? What is the Average Product of Capital $(AP_{K})$?

3. What is the $TRS_{L,K}$ ? Is the absolute value of $TRS_{L,K}$ diminishing in $K$? Is it diminishing in $L$?

4. Are there constant, decreasing, or increasing returns to scale? How does this depend on the parameters?  

### Solutions
1. 
$$
\begin{align}
MP_{L}&	=	\\frac{\partial Q}{\partial L}=AaL^{a-1}K^{b} \\\\
\\frac{\partial MP_{L}}{\partial L}	&=	Aa\left(a-1\right)L^{a-2}K^{b}<0 \\\\
MP_{K}	&=	\\frac{\partial Q}{\partial K}=AbL^{a}K^{b-1} \\\\
\\frac{\partial MK_{L}}{\partial K}	&=	Ab\left(b-1\right)L^{a}K^{b-2}<0 \\\\
\end{align}
$$
Since we know $0<a<1$ and $0<b<1$, we know that both marginal products are diminishing. This is because $a-1<0$ and $b-1<0$, and all other terms are positive.   

2.  
$AP_{L}	=	\\frac{Q}{L}=AL^{a-1}K^{b}$ and $AP_{K}	=	\\frac{Q}{K}=AL^{a}K^{b-1}$   

3. $$
\begin{align}
MRTS_{L,K}&=\\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}} \\\\
&=\\frac{AaL^{a-1}K^{b}}{AbL^{a}K^{b-1}}=\\frac{a}{b}\\frac{K}{L}.
\end{align}
$$
This diminishes as we increase $L$ and decrease $K$.

4. $$
\begin{align}
Q \left(TL,TK\right)	&=	A\left(TL\right)^{a}\left(TK\right)^{b} \\\\
	&=	AT^{a}L^{a}T^{b}K^{b} \\\\
	&=	T^{a+b}AL^{a}K^{b} \\\\
	&=	T^{a+b}Q\left(L,K\right)
\end{align}
$$
If $a+b=1$, the technology exhibits constant returns to scale. $If a+b<1$,  the technology exhibits decreasing returns to scale. $If a+b>1$,  the technology exhibits increasing returns to scale.

### Question 8:
Consider the following production function: $Q=\left(L+K\right)^{1/2}$

1. What is the Marginal Product of Labor $(MP_{L})$? What is the Marginal Product of Capital $(MP_{K})$? Are they diminishing? 

2. What is the Average Product of Labor $(AP_{L})$? What is the Average Product of Capital $(MP_{K})$?

3. What is the $TRS_{L,K}$ ? Is the absolute value of $TRS_{L,K}$  diminishing in $L$ or $K$?

4. Are there constant, decreasing, or increasing returns to scale?

### Solutions
1. $$
\begin{align}
MP_{L}	=	\\frac{\partial Q}{\partial L}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{\left(L+K\right)^{1/2}} \\\\
\\frac{\partial MP_{L}}{\partial L}	=	-\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{\left(L+K\right)^{3/2}}<0 \\\\
MP_{K}	=	\\frac{\partial Q}{\partial K}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{\left(L+K\right)^{1/2}} \\\\
\\frac{\partial MP_{K}}{\partial K}	=	-\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{\left(L+K\right)^{3/2}}<0.
\end{align}
$$
$MP_L$ is diminishing in $L$ and $MP_K$ is diminishing in $K$.

2. $$\begin{align}
AP_{L}	&=	\\frac{Q}{L}=\\frac{\left(L+K\right)^{1/2}}{L} \\\\
AP_{K}	&=	\\frac{Q}{K}=\\frac{\left(L+K\right)^{1/2}}{K}
\end{align}
$$

3.  $$\begin{align}
MRTS_{L,K}=-\\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}}=-\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{\left(L+K\right)^{1/2}}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{\left(L+K\right)^{1/2}}}=-1
\end{align}
$$
No, it is constant. 

4. $$\begin{align}
Q\left(TL,TK\right)	&=	\left(TL+TK\right)^{1/2} \\\\
	&=	\left[T\left(L+K\right)\right]^{1/2} \\\\
	&=	T^{1/2}\left(L+K\right)^{1/2} \\\\
	&=	T^{1/2}Q\left(L,K\right)
	\end{align}
$$

The technology exhibits decreasing returns to scale.
