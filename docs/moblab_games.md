## Competitive Market (Moblab) - Brief instructions

* Students are randomly and evenly split into buyers and sellers of oranges.
* By default, buyers demand three units (with decreasing marginal valuation) and sellers can provide up to three units (at an increasing marginal cost).
* A buyer can submit a Bid, while a seller can submit an Ask.
* A transaction occurs at the highest Bid if a seller presses "Sell at Highest Bid" or submits an Ask lower than the highest Bid.
* A transaction occurs at the lowest Ask if a buyer presses Buy at Lowest Ask or submits a Bid higher than the lowest Ask.
* When a transaction is completed, the participant that transacted can attempt to transact their next unit.
