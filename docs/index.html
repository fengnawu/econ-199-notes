## Why take this class?

* Well, it is a requirement!

* ...more important: this course gives you tools to *understand better* how _consumers_ and _firms_ make decisions, and how prices are determined

* Examples: 
    - Policy Analysis	
    - Marketing
    - Life decisions

----- 

## Why take this class? (2)

* This course provides tools that economists use to assess the benefits and costs of possible courses of actions 

* This course will sharpen your reasoning to determine if a certain action is “best” (optimal)

* Examples:

    - Do we increase the minimum wage? If so, by how much?

    - What is the optimal price for a product. Are we leaving money on the table?!

    - Is a company inefficiently allocating its resources, so that its costs are higher than they could be.

* **Microeconomics** is a body of concepts for understanding the economic behavior of individuals, firms and markets.

* We will highlight the different ways in which markets function; from perfectly competitive markets to monopolistic ones.

* We will study strategic interaction and market failures.

    - solving a system of two (or three) equations and two unknown variables,  
    - derivatives (get the concept and be able to compute the derivative of common functions).
    - Basic optimization
