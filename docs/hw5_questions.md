### Question 1: 
An automobile repair shop charges the competitive market price of ${$}$16 per bike repaired. The firm's short-run total cost is given by $STC(Q)=Q^{3}/3$.

1.  What quantity should the firm produce if it wants to maximize its profit?

2.  What is the maximized profit at the optimal level of quantity and the price of ${$}$16 $($ round to two decimal points $)$? 

3. Draw the shop's total revenue and total cost curves, and graph the total profit  on the same diagram. Using your graph, label the point of profit-maximizing quantity and its profit level.

4.  Suppose now the new price is $P'$. What is the profit-maximizing quantity as a function of $P'$. If the price increases by a factor of four $($i.e. price = 4P'$)$, how much does the profit-maximizing quantity increase? 

### Question 2: 
Consider a firm that operates in the perfectly competitive salmon farming industry. The short-run total cost curve is $TC\left(Q\right)=400+2Q+0.5Q^{2}$ , where $Q$ is the number of salmon harvested per month. 

1.  What is the equation for the average variable cost (AVC)?

2.  Solve for the firm's operation condition, $MC \geq AVC$.

3. Assuming $MC \geq AVC$, what is the firm's short-run supply curve? Find the supply function, NOT the inverse supply function. 

4. In light of the answer in part 2, What is the minimum price at which the firm operates?
 
### Question 3: 
A competitive industry consists of identical 30 producers, all of whom operate with the identical short-run total cost curve $TC(Q)=40+Q^{2}$, where $Q$ is the annual output of a firm. The market demand curve is $Q^D=160-P$, where $P$ is the market price.

1.  What is the each firm's short-run supply curve?

2.  What is the short-run **industry** supply curve?

3.  Determine the short-run equilibrium price and quantity in this industry.

### Question 4: 
The ethanol industry is perfectly competitive, and each producer has the long-run marginal cost function $MC(Q)=48-24Q+3Q^{2}$. The corresponding long-run average cost function is $AC(Q)=48-12Q+Q^{2}$. The market demand curve for ethanol is $Q^D=240-10P$.

1. What is one firm's **inverse** long-run supply curve with the minimum level of price for the firm to operate?

2. What is the optimal level of quantity produced by each firm in the long-run?

3. What is the long-run equilibrium price in this industry?

4. What is the long-run industry $($or market$)$ supply curve?

5. What is ther equilibrium quantity demanded in this market? How many active producers are in the ethanol market in a long-run competitive equilibrium?

### Question 5: 
The avocado growing industry in Chile is perfectly competitive, and each producer has a long-run marginal cost curve given by $MC\left(Q\right)=30+4Q$. The corresponding long-run average cost function is given by $AC\left(Q\right)=30+2Q+\\frac{50}{Q}$. The market demand curve is $Q^D=400-2P$.

1. What is the long-run quantity produced by each firm?

2. What is the long-run equilibrium price in this industry?

3.  How many active producers are in the avocado growing industry in the long-run competitive market?

### Question 6: 
Suppose that the market for cigarettes in a particular town has the following supply and demand curves: $Q^{S}=P$; $Q^{D}=60-P$.

1. What is the equilibrium quantity and price?

3.  Suppose that the town council wants to reduce cigarette consumption. It imposes a quantity tax per unit of cigarettes on the consumer side. Find the new equilibrium quantity, the equilibrium price paid by the consumer, and the equilibrium price received by the producer.

4. Suppose the flat tax is 20. What is the new equilibrium quantity, the price paid by consumer, and the price received by the supplier?

5. Compute the consumer surplus before and after tax. Draw the supply and demand curve and label the equilibrium quantity and prices. Also shade the area of the consumer surplus before and after tax. 

6. If the council wants to reduce cigarette sales to 5, what would the appropriate tax be?
