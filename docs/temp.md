## Utility Functions

* A preference relation that is complete, reflexive, transitive and continuous can be represented by a continuous utility function.

* Continuity means that small changes to a consumption bundle cause only small changes to the preference level.

## Utility Functions

* A utility function $ U(x) $ represents a preference relation $ \\succsim $ if and only if:

    * $ x' \\succ x'' \\iff u(x') > u(x'') $
