Late assignments will not be accepted. Only four randomly-chosen questions will be graded. It is graded out of 100 points and 5 points will be subtracted if you do not staple your homework. Question 1: You're waiting to board at an airport for a trip to Korea. You decided to buy cigarettes and Swiss chocolates for your friends at a shop in the airport. You have ${$}$30 only. A price for one pack of cigarettes is ${$}$2 and a price for one bar of Swiss chocolates is ${$}$3. You also learned from a traveller's book that you can only bring 10 packs of cigarettes into the country at the maximum and are not allowed to buy more than that $($\"cigarettes rationing\"). Write down the budget set and budget line in equations for the case without regulation on cigarettes amount. Draw a budget line for each of two cases in a same graph: without the regulation on cigarettes amount and with the regulation in place. Put Swiss chocolates on the $y$ axis and cigarettes on the $x$ axis. Label $x$ and $y$ intercepts. Suppose the price of a bar of Swiss chocolates increases to ${$}$4 due to an increase in cocoa powder. Draw a new budget line with the cigarettes rationing under the new price in the same graph. Can you afford an bundle $($cigarettes = 7 packs, chocolates = 5 bars$)$ under the old price of chocolates $($i.e. $p_2 = 3$ $)$? How about under the new price of chocolates $($i.e. $p_2 = 4$ $)$? Question 2: A consumer has an income of ${$}$1,000 to spend on food and medicine. The price of one unit of food is ${$}$5 and the price of one unit of medicine is ${$}$10. For each question, write down the mathematical expression of the budget constraint and draw it carefully. Put food on the x-axis and medicine on the y-axis. Label the incercepts, slopes, and kinks. Suppose the consumer receives coupons for 50 units of food and those can only be used to buy food. Suppose the consumer receives coupons for 50 units of food and can sell the coupons at half of the market price of the food. Instead of the coupon, the consumer receives a 20% discount for additional units of food that exceed 100 units. That is, the consumer pays ${$}$5 for each of the first 100 units and ${$}$4 for each additional unit. Question 3: This question allows you to evaluate how to think about the welfare of consumers. Assume a consumer's welfare is driven by what he/she consumes. Suppose there are only two types of goods to consume: food and leisure. An average Californian citizen has a daily income of ${$}$100. The price of one meal of food is ${$}$20 and the price $($or value$)$ of one unit of leisure is ${$}$10. An average citizen in Mississippi has a daily income of ${$}$50. The price of one unit of food is ${$}$10 and the price $($or value$)$ of one unit of leisure is ${$}$10. Who is more well-off in terms of the bundles of goods they can consume? $($hint: draw budget sets.$)$ Suppose you earn ${$}$100 per day. One day your boss increases your income by 50% solely due to your high performance at work. Are you more well-off, worse-off, the same, or cannot answer compared to before the change? Suppose the boss had lied to you. The reason why she increased your salary by 50% is because all other prices also increased by 50%. Are you more well-off, worse-off, the same, or cannot answer compared to before the change? Suppose you are a big fan of Japanese food and Chinese food and those are the only two goods you consume. Suppose your income does not change and the price of Japanese food decreases. However, the price of Chinese food increases. Are you more well-off, worse-off, the same, or cannot answer compared to before the changes in prices? Question 4: Answer the following questions regarding preferences: 4.1. Suppose you have two distinct bundles $ X $ and $ Y $, and, for you, $ X $ is strictly better than $ Y $. Explain briefly using a graph and words why the two indifference curves associated to two bundles $X$ and $Y$ -- $I(X)$ and $I(Y)$ cannot cross each other. 4.2. Explain using a graph and words why if the assumption of monotonic preferences $($aka \u201cmore-is-better\u201d$)$ implies that indifference curves are not thick and they must be downward sloped. 4.3. Provide three examples of goods that are typically regarded as perfect substitutes. Explain briefly. 4.4. Provide three examples of goods that are typically regarded as perfect complements. Explain briefly. Question 5: For each of the following functions, i) pick three utility levels and draw the precise indifference curves that are associated with the levels of your choice, ii) label the utility level of the lines -- you cannot just draw random lines and assign arbitrary utility levels, and iii) give the name of preferences they represent ( hint : see figures in textbook chapter 3). $u(x_1,x_2) = x_1 + x_2$ $u(x_1,x_2) = min(x_1, x_2)$ $u(x_1,x_2) = x_1$ $u(x_1,x_2) = x_1 - x_2$ $u(x_1,x_2) = \\sqrt{x_1 x_2}$ $u(x_1,x_2) = -${$(x_1 - 3)^2 + (x_2 - 2)^2$} Question 6: Draw an indifference curve and its weakly preferred set for two goods that exhibit following preferences: monotonic and convex preferences monotonic and concave preferences non-monotonic preferences Question 7: Consider a utility function $ u(x,y) = x^{a} y^{b} $, where $ 0 < a < 1 $ and $ 0 < b < 1 $. Also assume that $ x,y > 0 $. 7.1. Derive the marginal utility of $x$ and the marginal utility of $y$ and state whether or not the assumption that more is better is satisfied for both goods. 7.2. Does the marginal utility of $x$ diminish, remain constant, or increase as the consumer buys more $x$? What does it mean in words? 7.3. What is $MRS_{x,y}$? 7.4. Suppose $a,b = \\frac{1}{2}$. What is $MRS$ at $(x,y) = (1,4)$ and what does it mean in words? What is $MRS$ at $(x,y) = (4,1)$ and what does it mean in words? 7.5. Continue assuming $a,b = \\frac{1}{2}$. Draw two indifference curves of the utility function. To get full credit, draw one with the level of utility 2 and the other with the level of utility 3. For each indifference curve, label at least one point on the curve. 7.6. Draw tangent lines at $ (x,y) = (1,4) $ and $ (x,y) = (4,1) $ in the same graph and label the slopes you solved in $ MRS(1,4) $ and $ MRS(4,1) $. Question 8: 8.1. Consider a transformation of the utility function in Question 7 using $ u' = ln (u) $. In other words, the new utility function $ u' = ln (u) = ln(x^{a}y^{b}) = a \\times ln(x) + b \\times ln(y) $. What is $MRS_{x,y}$ of this new utility function? Is it the same as or different from $MRS_{x,y}$ you found in Q7.3? Explain. 8.2. Will the MRS be still the same for each of the following transformation? Explain without directly solving for MRS. a). $u' = u^2$ b). $u' = 1/u^2$ c). $u' = 1987 \\times u - 507$ d). $u' = e^u$ 8.3. Explain why taking a monotonic transformation of a utility function does not change the marginal rate of substitution (MRS).","title":"Homework 1 (Questions)"},{"location":"HW1_Questions/#homework-assignment-1","text":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A) Kristian L\u00f3pez Vargas UCSC - Spring 2017 Due on Friday 14 Apr 2017 Homework assignments will be turned-in on paper, at the beginning of the corresponding lecture.

Late assignments will not be accepted. Only four randomly-chosen questions will be graded. It is graded out of 100 points and 5 points will be subtracted if you do not staple your homework. Question 1: Luke's choice behavior can be represented by the utility function $u(x_1,x_2) = x_1 + x_2$. The prices of $x_1$ and $x_2$ are denoted as $p_1$ and $p_2$, and his income is $m$. Draw at least three indifference curves and find its slope $($i.e. MRS$)$. Is the MRS changing depending on the points of $(x_1,x_2)$ at which it is evaluated, or constant? Draw a budget constraint assuming that $p_1 < p_2$. Find the optimal bundle $ (x_1^{*},x_2^{*}) $ as a function of income and prices. Draw a budget constraint assuming that $p_1 > p_2$. Find the optimal bundle $ (x_1^{*},x_2^{*}) $ as a function of income and prices. Draw a budget constraint assuming that $p_1 = p_2$. Find the optimal bundle $ (x_1^{*},x_2^{*}) $ as a function of income and prices. Question 2: Lorelai's choice behavior can be represented by the utility function $$ u(x_1,x_2) = 0.9ln(x_1)+ 0.1x_2.$$ The prices of both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are ${$}$5 and she has an income of ${$}$40. What preference does this utility function represent? $($Hint: the utility is function is not linear, but at least linear in good $x_2$.$)$ Drawinwg indifference curves: you can copy down the graph on your paper using econgraphs . Set the preferences and parameters accordingly as given in the question. Click on \"snap to optimal bundle'' to see the optimal choice. Click on \"show indifference curve map.\" Draw the lowest four indifference curves as you see from the graph. Find the marginal utility of $x_1$ and $x_2$. What is the maximum number of $x_1$ so that $MU_{x_1}$ is bigger than or equal to $MU_{x_2}$? Given her income of ${$}$40, how many units of $x_1$ can she buy? Would she buy any positive number of $x_2$ in light of the answer from Q2.3? Find the optimal bundle. Suppose instead her income is ${$}$50. Would she buy any positive number of $x_2$? Find the optimal bundle using the tangency condition. Find the optimal bundle with an income of ${$}$100 using the tangency condition. What happens to the consumption amount of $x_1$ compared to the consumption of $x_1$ with an income of ${$}$50? $($Hint: In econgraphs , play around by moving an income slide bar and see how the optimal bundle changes.$)$ Will the optimal bundle be the same or different if the utility function were $u(x_1,x_2) = 9 ln(x_1) + x_2$? What if the utility function were $u(x_1,x_2) = x_1^9 \\times exp(x_2)$? Explain. Question 3: Paris has a utility function over berries $($denoted by $B$ $)$ and chocolate $($denoted by $C$ $)$ as follows: $$ U(B,C) = \\frac{1}{3} ln(B) + \\frac{2}{3} ln(C) $$ The price of berries and chocolate is $p_B$ and $p_C$, respectively.

Find the optimal bundle B and C as a function of income and prices using the tangency condition. What is the fraction of total expenditure spent on berries and chocolate out of total income, respectively? Now suppose Paris has an income of ${$}$300. The price of a container of berries is ${$}$5 and the price of a chocolate bar is ${$}$4. Find the numerical answers for the optimal bundle, by plugging the numbers into the solution you found in Q3.3. Question 4: Consider a general utility function $U(x_1, x_2)$. Let's now solve for the optimal bundle generally using the Lagrangian Method. 1. Write down the objective function and constraint in math. 2. Set up the Lagrangian Equation. 3. Fnd the first derivatives. 4. Find the first order conditions. What's the interpretation for $\\lambda$? 5. Rearrange them to get the tangency condition. Question 5: Jess has the utility function $U(x_1,x_2) = min ${$ 2x_1, x_2 $}$ $. The price of $x_1$ is $p_{x_1}$, the price of $x_2$ is $p_{x_2}$, and his income is $m$. 1. Find Jess\u2019s optimal bundle $x_1^{*}$ and $x_2^{*}$ as a function of $p_{x_1}$, $p_{x_2}$, and $m$. 2. What's the proportion of consumption amounts between $x_1^{*}$ and $x_2^{*}$? In other words, find $\\frac{x_1^{*}}{x_2^{*}}$. 3. Suppose instead the utility function is $U(x_1,x_2) = min ${$ \\frac{x_1}{2}, \\frac{x_2}{3} $}$ $. Without solving for the optimal bundles, what's the proportion of consumption amounts between $x_1^{*}$ and $x_2^{*}$, i.e. $\\frac{x_1^{*}}{x_2^{*}}$? Question 6: Logan has preferences over olives $(x_1)$ and ice creams $(x_2)$. He prefers to eat them separately but not together, which is represented by: $$ U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2.$$ Also suppose his income is ${$}$100 and the prices of olives and ice creames are $p_{x_1} = {$}1$ and $p_{x_2} = {$}2$, respectively. Is this convex preferences or concave preferences? Solve for the bundle that satisfis the tangency condition. What's the level of utility using the bundle you just solved in Q6.2? Consider spending all of your income on olives $(x_1)$. What's the utility from this bundle? Which bundle does Logan prefer between the bundle in Q6.2 and Q6.4? Does the tangency condition lead to the optimal bundle? What's the optimal bundle when price of olives is ${$}$3. Question 7: Consider a utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = 2x_1 + x_2$. What is the optimal bundle with $p_{x_1}$, $p_{x_2}$, and income $m$? What is the optimal bundle with $p_{x_1} = 6$, $p_{x_2} = 3$, and income $30$? Question 8: Consider a utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = \\sqrt{x_1} + \\sqrt{x_2}$. 1. What is the optimal bundle with $p_{x_1}$, $p_{x_2}$, and income $m$? 2. $($optional$)$ Would the corner solution where all income is spent on single good be possible?","title":"HW2 Questions"},{"location":"HW2_Questions/#homework-assignment-2","text":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A) Kristian L\u00f3pez Vargas UCSC - Spring 2017 Due on Friday 21 Apr 2017 Homework assignments will be turned-in on paper, at the beginning of the corresponding lecture.

Shifts in Demand can be caused by: Number of Buyers Change In Consumer Preferences Price of Other Goods Income Expectations of buyers The Demand Curve & Surplus The demand curve represents how much all consumers want to buy (or demand ) at each price level. Consumer Surplus: is the difference between the amount that consumers are willling and able to pay for a good or service and what they actually pay. Consumer Surplus acts as a measure of consumer welfare . Consumer Surplus Supply - Determinants of the Supply curve (reminder) Supply Shifters are changes in the conditions of production that can have a positive, or negative effect on the supply curve. Examples of Shifts in Supply, Number of Sellers Resource Prices Technology Taxes and Subsidies Expectations of Producers Prices of Other Goods the Firm Could Produce The Producer Surplus Producer Surplus is the difference between what producers are willing and able to accept for each good they supply and the price they actually receive. The producer surplus is a measure of producers' benefit. Producer Surplus Market Equilibrium The demand and supply curves summarize the optimal choices of all agents involved. If price is below my valuation I want to buy more. Similar for sellers: if p > MC, I want to sell more. Equilibrium price: Price $ p^* $ such that $ Q^d (p^*) = Q^s (p^*) $ What if $ p \\neq p^* $ ? agents exert pressure on market price towards equilibrium level. We will use $ Q^d (p) $ or $ D(p) $ interchangeably. Similar for $ Q^s (p) $ or $ S(p) $. Total Surplus Market Equilibrium We reach economic efficiency in the market, when total surplus is maximized. \"All gains from trade (between buyers and suppliers) are exhausted at the efficient point.\" It turns out that under competitive conditions, price mechanism is indeed efficient. There is no better way to maximize total surplus. Equilibrium with Linear Curves Let us find the equilibrium price, $ p^* $, by equating the Supply and Demand functions. $ D(p) = a - bp $ $ S(p) = c + dp $ To find eqm price, set $ D(p) = S(p) $ (solving...) $ p^* = \\frac{a-c}{d+b} $ To find equilibrium quantity demanded, replace $ p^* $ into $ D(p) $ or $ S(p) $ (solving...) $ Q^* = \\frac{ad + bc}{d+b} $ Inverse Demand and Supply Curves Calculating the Inverse simply implies solving for price in the respective equation. If $ Q^d = f(p) $, then the inverse demand is $ p = f^{-1}( Q^d ) $ Inverse D(p) and S(p) Curves - Home Exercise Assume you are in the short run of the industry. Number of firms is fixed. Take the linear demand and linear supply of our previous example and calculate the inverse demand and supply curves. Now equate the inverse demand and the inverse supply to find the equilibrium quantity Q*. Replace Q* in the inverse demand (or inverse supply) to find the equilibrium price. You should have obtained the same solutions: $ Q^* = \\frac{ad + bc}{d+b} $ and $ p^* = \\frac{a-c}{d+b} $ The long run of the industry (or the market) The long run of the industry The long run in the industry is the time horizon in which: All the firm\u2019s inputs and production factors can be adjusted, and, The number of firms in the industry can increase or decrease.

Find the market equilibrium in the LONG run of the industry. Taxes in the short run of the industry If there is a tax money \"spent\" by consumers is different than the money \"kept\" by sellers: $ P_D \\neq P_S $. A quantity tax implies that part ($t) of the money paid for a unit of the good goes to the government. $ P_D = P_S + t ~~ $ (assuming seller pays the tax) Now consider the equilibrium price with taxes: $ D(P_D) = S(P_S) $ and substitute in the quantity tax \"equation\". Our new equilibrium condition: $ D(P_D)=S(P_D-t) $ A value tax (or ad valorem): is a charge as a percentage of the price of the good: $ P_D = (1+ \\tau ) P_S ~~ $ (assuming seller pays the tax) Equilibrium condition: $ ~ D(P_D) = S\\left( \\frac{P_D}{ 1+\\tau } \\right) $ E.g. if tax is 9%, then ($ \\tau = 0.09 $). Taxes - Who pays the taxes? Suppose that the buyer pays the tax: $ P_D - t = P_S $ Note, however, this is the same equation found in our previous slide ($ P_D = P_S + t$), just expressed differently. This indicates that it doesn't matter where the tax is levied (either on the supply or the demand side). The burden of the tax will be distributed between sellers and buyers in the same way, regardless of the stated \"intention\" of the tax authority. Quantity Tax - Example Let us consider an equation with linear supply and demand: $ D(P_d) = a - b P_d ~ $ and $ ~ S(P_s) = c + d P_s $ A quantity tax is imposed on this good: $ P_D = P_S + t $ We want to find $ P_S^* $ and $ P_D^* $: $ \\begin{align} a - b P_D &= c + d P_s \\\\ a - b (P_s + t) &= c + d P_s \\\\ P_s^* &= \\frac{ a-c-bt }{ d+b } \\end{align} $ Also, $ P_D^* = P_S^* + t $. Where does the burden of the tax fall? Passing Along a Tax Two most simple cases regarding tax burden lie in the extremes of the supply curve. Perfectly elastic supply (completely horizontal) suggest that there are unlimited firms producing a good at a certain price and zero producing at any lower price. Any firm that wants to charge more, or less, than the going rate will be out of business in no time. The second case involves a perfect inelastic supply that suggests a good produced is fixed and no tax will move its production. In this case, none of the tax gets passed on to the consumer. Dead Weight Loss The loss of economic benefit that comes from inefficient allocation of resources. With taxes there is a wedge between $ P_D $ and $ P_S $ (in fact: $ P_D > P_S $). Some transactions are lost. DWL is the \"value\" of transactions that would occur in an efficient mechanism, but do not occur due to the wedge created by the tax. Wait! but the government is collecting taxes right? Maybe that is enough to compensate for the loss... Let us see: consumers and producers lose on surplus more than what the government collects in tax revenue! Dead Weight Loss - Example Demand: $ Q^d = 10 - 0.5 P^d $ Supply: $Q^{s}= \\text{max}(-2+P^s, 0) $ 1.- Find first the equilibrium with no tax: $ Q^{d} = Q^{s} $ and $ P^{s} = P^{d} = P^* $ Solving: $ P^* = 8 $ and $ Q^* = 6 $ Dead Weight Loss - Example 2.- Now consider a quantity tax of $6 and find the equilibrium with tax : Equilibrium satisfies now two equations: $ P^d = P^s + 6 $ and $ Q^d = Q^s $ Then: $ 10 - 0.5 (P^s+6) = -2 + P^s $ ...Solve for $ P^s $ $ P^s =6 $; $ P^d = 12 $; $ Q^* = 4 $","title":"Equilibrium (Chapter 16)"},{"location":"S12_Equilibrium_Ch16/#competitive-market-equilibrium","text":"","title":"(Competitive Market) Equilibrium"},{"location":"S12_Equilibrium_Ch16/#intermediate-microeconomics-econ-100a","text":"","title":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A)"},{"location":"S12_Equilibrium_Ch16/#kristian-lopez-vargas","text":"","title":"Kristian L\u00f3pez Vargas"},{"location":"S12_Equilibrium_Ch16/#ucsc-spring-2017","text":"","title":"UCSC - Spring 2017"},{"location":"S12_Equilibrium_Ch16/#demand-determinants-of-the-demand-curve-reminder","text":"Demand Shifters can either have a positive (right shift) or negative (left shift) to the demand curve.

In a competitive market, producers determine best quantity for a given price (firms are price-takers ). In monopoly, the firm can either determine the price and consumers decide how many units to buy (demand curve), or, equivalently, the firm determines the output and consumers determine the price (inverse demand $ p(q) $ ). We adopt the latter approach. Monopolist cannot determine arbitrary q and p at the same time - the monopolist keeps in mind the demand of the consumer as a restriction, and chooses $ q $ in order to maximize profit ($ \\pi = p(q) \\times q $). Reminder Total Revenue: $ TR(q) = p \\times q $ Total revenue of a competitive firm is linear in q, because the price is given for the firm. Total revenue of the monopolist not linear because the price changes with quantity ( $ p(q) $ ). Make sure you understand this well before you continue. Monopolist Maximizing Profits The monopolist's profit-maximization problem : Maximize profits: $ ~ \\text{max}_q: \\pi(q) = TR(q) - c(q) $. That is, we want to choose $ q $ that gives highest profit: At the peak of the profit \"hill\" it must be flat, right? This is what mathematically we called the first-order condition: $ \\frac{d\\pi}{dq} = \\frac{dTR}{dq} - \\frac{dc}{dq} = 0 $ In other words, monopolist wants to produce $ q $ such that: $ MR(q) = MC(q) $ We often denote this quantity as $ q^M $. Solving the problem graphically see document camera Monopolist - Marginal Revenue Let's look at $ MR(q) $ more closely (reminder: although we do not always write it like that, remember $ p $ always represents the inverse demand , $ p(q) $, in the monopoly case). Since $ ~ TR(q) = p(q) \\times q $, then: $ \\begin{align} MR(q) &= \\frac{d TR(q)}{ d q} \\\\ &= p + q \\frac{dp}{ d q} \\\\ &= p + q \\frac{dp}{ d q} \\frac{p}{p} \\\\ &= p ( 1 + \\frac{dp}{ d q} \\frac{q}{p}) \\\\ &= p \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{ \\epsilon(q)} \\right) \\\\ &= p \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{ | \\epsilon(q) | } \\right) \\end{align} $ Back to Maximizing Profits Remember to maximize profits we want: $ ~ MR(q) = MC(q) $ But we just learned that: $ ~ MR(q) = p \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{ | \\epsilon(q) | } \\right) $ Therefore: $ ~ p \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{ | \\epsilon(q) | } \\right) = MC(q) $ Since $ \\left( 1 - 1/ | \\epsilon(q) | \\right) < 1 $, the monopolist will set $ p > MC $. That is, the consumer pays more for an extra unit of production than what it costs society to produce that unit. Inefficiency! In contrast, in a competitive markets we had: $ price = MC $. Also, notice that monopolist produces at a $ q^M $ such that: $ |\\epsilon| > 1 $ Monopoly in a Linear Demand Curve - Example A monopolist, faces a linear inverse demand curve $ ~ p = a - b q ~ $, and has this cost function $ ~c(q) = c q ~$, for $ ~ a, b, c > 0 ~ $: The profit maximization problem is: $ ~ \\text{max}_q ~~ \\pi = TR(q) - c(q) = (a-bq) q - cq $ (1) Find marginal revenue and marginal cost functions: $ ~~ MR(q) = a - 2bq ~~$ and $ ~~ MC(q) = c $ (2) Equate the two and solve for q: $ a-2bq = c ~~ $. It follows that: $ ~ q^M = \\frac{(a-c)}{2b} $ (3) Plug $ q^M $ into inverse demand and find the price of the monopolist: $ ~ p^M = \\frac{(a+c)}{2} $ Numerical Example! (home) SC Municipal Utility is the sole provider of water to Santa Cruz residents and faces the following demand for water (in gallons): $ q^d = 100 - p $. Also, $ TC = 2q $. Step 0: Inverse Demand: $ p = 100 - q^d $ Step 1: Find MR and MC $ TR = Pq = (100 - q)~q = 100q -q^2 $ $ MR = \\frac{dTR}{dq} = 100 - 2q ~ $ and $ ~ MC = \\frac{dTC}{dq} = 2 $ Step 2: Set MR = MC and find $ q^M $ $ 2 = 100 - 2q ~ $, then: $ ~q^M = 49 $ Step 3: Find $ p^M $ by plugging in $ q^M $ into the inverse demand: $ p^M = 100 - q^M = 51 $ Inefficiencies Of Monopoly While a competitive industry operates where price = marginal cost , monopolized industry operates where price > marginal cost ; which results in lower output. Consumers are typically worse off under a monopoly: Suppose you are willing to pay 7 dollars for a burrito, while $ MC = 5 $ and $ P_M = 10 $. Sorry, you don\u2019t get to buy it\u2026 In a monopoly, there are consumers that are willing to pay more than what it would cost to make those extra units (MC), but they are priced out. This would not happen in a competitive market. Inefficiencies Of Monopoly - Prices and Quantity Let us consider $ (Q_M,P_M) $ as the optimal production set of a monopolist and $ (Q_C,P_C) $ the optimal production for a competitive firm. Inefficiencies Of Monopoly - Deadweight Loss B + C represent the DWL; If pricing is competitive consumers would gain area A + B. Inefficiencies Of Monopoly - Deadweight Loss Interactive version: Patents and Patent Thickets (readings) A patent is a license from the government that offers exclusive rights to produce an invention. The life of a patent in the United States is 17 years. A patent thicket refers to the dense and overlapping series of patents an incumbent company might own to fend off competition. Companies can file a \"preliminary injunction\" against a company they feel infringes on their patents. Top tier companies arm themselves with dense patent thickets. Owning a dense thicket allows protection from injunctions due to the fear of a counter injunction. Natural Monopoly A natural monopoly occurs generally when there are high fixed costs low marginal costs . Examples of natural monopolies include the gas network, electricity grid, and railway infrastructure. Natural Monopoly If a natural monopoly is forced to operate at a competitive market's price, $ MC = price $, it would incur in loses from producing under the $ AC $ curve. What Causes Monopolies? Remember that a monopolist IS the whole of the supply side of a product. A monopolist must then have the means of producing the large volume of product. The minimum efficient scale (MES) represents the level of output that minimizes average cost . A monopolist must then have a large minimum efficient scale $ \\underline{relative} $ to the demand. What Causes Monopolies? (readings) Graph A represents a demand much larger relative to the MES. Graph B has a comparable MES relative to demand . Cartels (readings) A cartel occurs when a few firms decide to collude and artificially hike prices to monopoly levels and drive out competition. The biggest cartel in the world is OPEC, owning 80% of the worlds reserves in oil. Price fixing is illegal in the United States; the US courts do not have jurisdiction to try foreign anti-trust cases. OPEC has used their influence to cause a massive shortage of gasoline. In 1973, due to retaliation from US involvement in the Yom Kippur War, OPEC imposed an oil embargo. Tax Effects on a Monopolist Graphically (readings) Let us examine what would happen to price if we imposed a quantity tax on the market. If we were to gear the tax towards the monopolist, the price of output would increase marginal cost by the tax ($ MC + t $) In the case of a linear demand curve, where the marginal revenue is twice as steep demand curve, the price goes up by half the amount of the tax Monopoly behavior beyond unique, uniform pricing Perfect price discrimination: charging each customer a different price. Efficient level of output BUT CS = 0. Charge different prices in two different markets: Firm will charge the lower price in the market where demand is more elastic. If monopolist can set a two-part tariff: it will want to set price equal to MC and make all of its profits from the entry fee.","title":"Monopoly (Chapter 25)"},{"location":"S13_Monopoly_Ch25/#monopoly","text":"","title":"Monopoly"},{"location":"S13_Monopoly_Ch25/#intermediate-microeconomics-econ-100a","text":"","title":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A)"},{"location":"S13_Monopoly_Ch25/#kristian-lopez-vargas","text":"","title":"Kristian L\u00f3pez Vargas"},{"location":"S13_Monopoly_Ch25/#ucsc-spring-2017","text":"","title":"UCSC - Spring 2017"},{"location":"S13_Monopoly_Ch25/#monopoly_1","text":"A monopoly is the exclusive possession of an industry's supply.

This reaction fn is F1's best response to his/her believe regarding F2's behavior, $ q_2^e $. Similarly, we maximize firm 2's profit to find F2's reaction function: FOC wrt $ q_2 $: $ ~~ a - 2 b q_2 - b q_1^e = c $ Which implies this reaction function (aka best response fn): $ q_2 = \\frac{a-c}{2b} - \\frac{q_1^e}{2} $ Solving $ q_1, q_2 $ from the system of two reaction functions yields.

Since $ \\pi(q_i) = p(Q) \\times q_i - c(q_i) $, we can use the fact that $ \\frac{dp}{dq_i} = \\frac{dp}{dQ} $ to write the FOCs of firm $ i $ as follows: $ p(Q) + \\frac{dp}{dQ}q_i = MC(q_i) ~$, where the left-hand side is simply the MR of firm $ i $. There are a total of $ n $ FOC equations like this one (since $ i = {1,2,3,...,n} $ ) and so you have a system of n equations and n unknowns that you can solve to find $ q_1^C, q_2^C, ... , q_n^C $ . In the case of the the linear inverse demand (p = a - bQ) and constant MC (MC = c), the equilibrim of the n-firm Cournot oligopoly is given by: $ ~~q_i^C = \\frac{a-c}{(n+1)b} ~~ $, and $ ~~p^C = \\frac{a+nc}{n+1} ~ $ Do this interesting exercise at home and think about what happens when $ n \\rightarrow \\infty $ Simultaneous Price Setting - Bertrand Oligopoly What if, instead of setting quantities, firms set prices and allowed consumer to decide how much to buy? This is called a Bertrand Oligopoly . In the equilibrium a la Bertrand, each firms sets a price such that, given the prices of other firms, she cannot obtain a higher profit by choosing a different price. Bertrand Oligopoly - Equilibrium Suppose two firms have identical costs (say, MC = $c) and they produce identical goods. Firm $ 1 $ believes the other will charge $ p_2 $ and decides to charge $ p_1 $ upon that belief. Both set prices simultaneously. Because any firm that undercuts its rival captures the entire market and earns positive profit, firms will undercut each other until they hit their MC. That is, while possible $ p_1 $ will always be set just below $ p_2^e $ or at mc if $ mc > p_2^e $. These incentives make the simultaneous price setters to push their price down to the Bertrand Equilibrium : Equilibrium price = MC: $ p_1^B = p_2^B = MC $, $ Q^B $ can be found from the market demand curve. Bertrand Equilibrium Bertrand - Home Exercise Suppose $ MC_1 = 4 $ and $ MC_1 = 5 $, and prices can be set in pennies at the least. What is the Bertrand Equilibrium? Sequential Competition Quantity Leadership - Stackelberg Let us assume there are two firms that produce identical products and have identical cost. Quantity Leadership: there is a leader and a follower that set their quantities in sequential order. The leader (F1): larger, more dominant firm in the market, sets its quantity first ( $ q_1 $ ). The follower (F2): smaller firm, observes the leader's behavior and then sets its quantity second ( $ q_2 $ ). As before, the total market output is $ Q = q_1 + q_2 $. Quantity Leadership - Stackelberg Oligopoly The leader is aware that the follower will act after him, and so that the follower will affect the market price. The leader then needs to analyze what the follower will choose. That is the leader will \"solve\" the follower's problem, first. Then she incorporates that insight to find out her optimal leader output level. We call this \"backward induction\" solution. Stackelberg Oligopoly The Follower's Profit maximization is: $ \\text{max}_{q_2}: {\\pi}_2 = p(q_1 + q_2) \\times q_2 - c_2(q_2) $ Where output of the leader is treated as a constant. Finding MR = MC: $ MR_2 = p(q_1 + q_2) + \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial q}q_2 = MC_2 $ This looks a lot like a monopolist's maximization except with a \"residual demand\" (demand that the leader left unserved). So the profit maximizing choice will depend on the choices of the leader. Solving for q_2 from that FOC we can get the follower's reaction function: $ q_2 = f_2(q_1) $ Stackelberg Oligopoly The Leader's Profit maximization is: $ \\text{max}_{q_1}: {\\pi}_1 = p(q_1 + f_2(q_1)) \\times q_1 - c_1(q_1) $ Where output of the follower is NOT treated as a constant. As always, the leader solves for his optimal $ q_1^S $ by doing: $ \\frac{ d {\\pi}_1 }{ d q_1 } = 0 ~~ $ to obtain: $ q_1^S $ Equilibrum: $ q_1^S ~~$, $ q_2^S = f_2(q_1^S) ~~$, $ p^S = p(q_1^S + q_2^S) $. Stackelberg Oligopoly - Linear Example Market Inverse Demand: $ p = a - bQ = a - b(q_1 + q_2) ~$. Costs: $ TC_i = c q_i ~~ $, so $ MC_i = c $ Finding Stackelberg Equilibrium Step 1: Leader \"solves\" followers problem: $ ~~ \\text{max}_{q_2}: {\\pi}_2 = (a - b(q_1 + q_2)) ~ q_2 - c ~ q_2 $ We make $ d \\pi_2 / d q_2 = 0 $ and find solution -> the follower's reaction function: $ q_2 = f_2(q_1) = \\frac{a\u2212c}{2b} \u2212 \\frac{1}{2} q_1 $ Stackelberg Oligopoly - Linear Example (2) Step 2: Leader solves his problem with the insight of step 1: $ ~~ \\text{max}_{q_1}: {\\pi}_1 = (a - b(q_1 + f_2(q_1) )) ~ q_1 - c ~ q_1 $ That is: $ ~~ \\text{max}_{q_1}: {\\pi}_1 = (a - b(q_1 + \\frac{a\u2212c}{2b} \u2212 \\frac{1}{2} q_1 )) ~ q_1 - c ~ q_1 $ We make $ d \\pi_1 / d q_1 = 0 $ and find solution -> the leaders's final optimal output: $ q_1^S = \\frac{a-c}{2b} $ Step 3: Using $ ~q_1^S $, calculate $ ~q_2=f_2(q_1) $, $ ~Q = q_1 + q_2 $, and $ ~p^S = a - b Q $ Stackelberg Equilibrium: $ q_1^S = \\frac{a-c}{2b} ~$, $ q_2^S = f_2(q_1) = \\frac{a-c}{4b} ~$, $ p^S = \\frac{a + 3c}{4} $ Stackelberg Equilibrium","title":"Oligopoly (Chapter 28)"},{"location":"S14_Oligopoly_Ch28/#oligopoly","text":"","title":"Oligopoly"},{"location":"S14_Oligopoly_Ch28/#intermediate-microeconomics-econ-100a","text":"","title":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A)"},{"location":"S14_Oligopoly_Ch28/#kristian-lopez-vargas","text":"","title":"Kristian L\u00f3pez Vargas"},{"location":"S14_Oligopoly_Ch28/#ucsc-spring-2017","text":"","title":"UCSC - Spring 2017"},{"location":"S14_Oligopoly_Ch28/#oligopoly_1","text":"Oligopoly is the study of a market served by a small number of firms.

BUT many other economic interactions do not have that core feature and agents do find themselves in interdependent / strategic interactions. Interdependence (or strategic interdependence) means that my satisfaction or profit depends on my actions AND the actions of at least one other specific player. Therefore, I need to care for what s/he does or does not... I use a strategy. A game is an interaction with strategic interdependence. Types of Games Timing: Static Games: Each player acts simultaneously, only once and has complete information about the payoff functions but imperfect information about rivals\u2019 moves. Dynamic Games: Players act sequentially. Usually assumed that each player has perfect recall of what happened prior to his/her turn to decide. Information: Complete information (payoff function is common knowledge among all players) is different from Perfect information (player knows full history of game up to the point he is about to move) Game Theory - Static, Simultaneous-Move Games Unless stated otherwise, we will assume we are in a \"one-shot\" (one round only) interaction. Payoff's will be apparent to the players after the choices have been made (simultaneous game). Typically, we use a payoff matrix that arranges all the possible outcomes a game can have. Static Games - Representation We use a payoff matrix when we have few strategies per player. Best Response Correspondence The best response correspondence is the choice a player will make that will maximize her payoff, given the other players strategy. If there is more than one optimal response; your best response will be all of the choices in the set. See examples in document camera. Dominant Strategy A strategy $ s $ is a dominant strategy if it produces higher payoff than other strategies regardless of rivals\u2019 strategies. In other words, if a player has an optimal strategy irrespective of the other player's move, such a strategy is the \"dominant strategy\". See examples in document camera. A strategy $ s' $ is a \u201cdominated strategy\u201d if for every strategy played by the opponent, there is another action the player can take and obtain higher payoff than with $ s' $. If the best response set does not vary with what the opponent chooses and is unique, then the only strategy in the best response set is the dominant strategy. Dominant Strategy equilibrium Dominant strategy equilibrium represents the combination of strategies that players in the game arrive at when everyone has used their own dominant strategy . There can be a dominant strategy equilibrium only when all players have a dominant strategy. Nash Equilibrium We say that a set of strategies in a game forms a Nash Equilibrium if: Agents are MUTUALLY BEST RESPONDING to each other's played strategies. So no player has an incentive to deviate from what they are playing. When all other players use in fact those strategies, one cannot obtain a higher playoff by choosing a different strategy. Example: Cournot's equilibrium. Nash Equilibrium in Pure Strategies NE: (Player A, Top); (Player A, Left) Mixed Strategies So far, players have used pure strategies, which means that each player chooses a single action. A mixed strategy is when a player chooses among possible actions probabilistically (flipping coins, tossing the dice, etc.) A pure strategy assigns a probability of 1 to a single action, and zero to the other actions. In a mixed strategy, more than one strategy receives a probability greater than zero. OK, but WHY Mixed Strategies? Practical point of view: In some games you want to be unpredictable Tennis service Penalty kick in football Poker War Mathematical point of view: Needed if pure strategy equilibria do not exist May coexist with pure strategy NE Mixed Strategies - Example Calculate expected payoff if both players play 50/50 chances between their strategies: Best response curves (in simultaneous games) Let's go deeper into finding mixed strategy Nash Equilibria Consider the simple game in which the players are given the matrix beforehand- Suppose $ b_c(r) $ is the best response for column player and $ b_r(c) $ is the best response for player row. Nash Equilibrium is the strategy profile ($ r^* $, $ c^* $) such that: $ c^* = b_c(r^*) ~~ $ and $ ~ r^* = b_r(c^*) $ N.E. in pure strategies: NE1: $ ~(r^* = Top $ , $ c^* = Left) ~$ and NE2: $ ~(r^* = Bottom$ , $ c^* = Right) ~$ Best response curves - adding mixed Strategies Let's add mixed strategies to what we know about best response curves. $ r = $ probability row plays top. $ 1-r $ probability row plays bottom. $ c = $ probability column plays left. $ 1-c $ probability column plays right. We have pure strategies is $ r $ and $ c $ are equal to either 0 or 1. Let's now calculate the payoff of the row and the columns Best response curves - adding mixed Strategies Combination Probability Row's Payoff Column's Payoff Top, Left $ r ~ c $ 2 1 B, L $ (1-r)~c $ 0 0 T, R $ r~(1-c) $ 0 0 B, R $ (1-r)~(1-c) $ 1 2 Calculating Row's Expected Payoff Row's Expected Payoff becomes: $ \\pi_{row}(r,c) = 2rc+ (1-r)(1-c) = 2rc+1-r-c +rc = (3c - 1)r + (1- c) $ Row chooses $ r $ so the key term is $ (3c - 1) $ This implies: $ r^*(c)= \\begin{cases} 0 ~~~if ~c < 1/3 \\\\ 1 ~~~if ~c > 1/3 \\\\ [0,1 ] ~~~if ~c = 1/3 \\\\ \\end{cases} $ Calculating Column's Expected Payoff Columns's Expected Payoff becomes: $ \\pi_{column}(r,c) = rc+ 2(1-r)(1-c) = rc + 2 - 2r - 2c + 2rc = (3r - 2)c + 2(1 - r) $ Columns chooses $ c $ so the key term is $ (3r - 2) $ This implies: $ c^*(r)= \\begin{cases} 0 ~~~if ~r < 2/3 \\\\ 1 ~~~if ~r > 2/3 \\\\ [0,1 ] ~~~if ~r = 2/3 \\\\ \\end{cases} $ Best Response Curves Let's draw then: How many Equilibria do you see? Sequential Games Consider the following \"The new entry game\" where the Incumbent can choose to drive prices down if the entrant joins the market. Key concepts: Decision node; Proper subgame; Strategy vs. Action; Payoff pairs. Sequential Games - Key concepts In games where players move sequentially, we distinguish between an action and a strategy. An action is a move that a player makes at a specified point (decision node). A strategy is a complete plan that specifies the action a player will make based on information available at each decision node. (e.g, Entrant: Enters; Incumbent: Fight if Entrant Enters; Incumbent: Don't Fight if Entrant Stays Out;) A strategy profile is simply a particular combination of strategies implemented by all players. Sequential Games - Key concepts A subgame is a subset of game that starts at an independent node and can be analyzed in isolation of other subgames. A subgame-perfect equilibrium is A strategy profile that constitutes a Nash equilibrium for every proper \"subgame\". We find the equilibrium using backward induction and that is why we also call it \"backward induction equilibrium\". Game Applications Games of Coordination Coordination games involve both (or more) players to work together to obtain the highest payoff. The constraining aspect to this game is lack of communication that can arise. Battle of the Sexes \"Battle of the Sexes\" is a coordination game Prisoner's Dilemma Prisoner's Dilemma Summed up: two people convicted of a crime are questioned. Each can choose to confess (implicating the other) and take less punishment, or deny and take risk of being implicated. 2 confessions = mild punishment, both deny = negligible punishment. The (unique) dominant strategy dictates that you are better off confessing than to risk being implicated. Pareto Efficiency occurs when all resources are allocated efficiently. Is this the case here?

Introduction What is Microeconomics Microeconomics is the study of how individual economic decision-makers such as consumers, workers, firms or managers allocate scarce resources among alternate uses.

What constrains consumption choice? Budgetary, time and other resource limitations. Consumption bundle A consumption bundle containing $ x_1 $ units of commodity 1, $ x_2 $ units of commodity 2 and so on up to $ x_n $ units of commodity n is denoted by the vector $ ( x_1, x_2, \u2026 , x_n ) $. Prices or goods are denoted by: $ p_1, p_2, \u2026 , p_n $. Affordable Bundles - Budget Constraints Suppose prices are $ p_1, p_2, \u2026 , p_n $ and a consumer has $ m $ as income. Question: When is a consumption bundle $ (x_1, \u2026 , x_n) $ affordable at those given prices and income? Affordable Bundles - Budget Constraints Answer: when $ p_1 x_1 + \u2026 + p_n x_n \\leq m $ where $ m $ is the consumer\u2019s (disposable) income. That is, all the bundles that when purchased do not exhaust the consumer's income. \"Budget line\" or \"budget constraint\" The bundles that are only just affordable form the consumer\u2019s budget constraint or budget line. This is the set: $ \\{ ( x_1 ,\u2026, x_n ) \\quad:\\quad p_1 x_1 + \u2026 + p_n x_n = m \\} $ For simplicity we will only work with $ x_1, \u2026 , x_n $ are all equal or greater than zero. Budget Set The consumer\u2019s budget set is the set of all affordable bundles; $ B(p_1, \u2026 , p_n, m) = \\{ (x_1, \u2026 , x_n) \\quad:\\quad p_1 x_1 + \u2026 + p_n x_n \\leq m \\} $ The budget constraint (or budget line) is the upper boundary of the budget set. Budget for Two Commodities $ p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 = m $. Affordable set, intercepts, slope. Budget for Three Commodities Finding the slope of the BC Budget line: $ p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 = m $ Solve for $ x_2 $ : $ p_2 x_2 = m - p_1 x_1 $ $ x_2 = \\frac{m}{p_2} - \\frac{p_1}{p_2} x_1 $ Therefore the slope is: $ - \\frac{p_1}{p_2} $ What is the interpretation: relative price . Example of BC Good one is beer (good 1) and orange juice (good 2). Suppose $ p_1 = 3 $ and $ p_2 = 1 $. Income = 100 slope = - 3: Consumer need to give up (buy less) 3 oz. of orange juice to afford (be able to buy) 1 additional oz of beer. You can use the market to transform three units of OJ into one unit of beer, at the current prices. Therefore the term of relative price Changes in the BC The budget constraint and budget set depend upon prices and income. What happens as prices or income change? Income change? Prices change? Board - Doc Camera Makler's EconGraphs Introducing EconGraphs Income Changes What bundles become unaffordable or newly affordable? Income Increases Increases in income m shift the constraint outward in a parallel manner, thereby enlarging the budget set and improving choice. Decreases in income m shift the constraint inward in a parallel manner, thereby shrinking the budget set and reducing choice. Which one is \"good\" for consumer? Price Changes What bundles become unaffordable or newly affordable? $ p_1 $ increases $ p_1 $ increases from $ p_1 $ to $ p_1' $ Budget constraint pivots: slope get steeper from $ -p_1 / p_2 $ to $ -p_1'/p_2 $ Increasing the price of one commodity pivots the constraint inward. Some old choices are lost, so increasing one price could make the consumer worse off. Ad Valorem Sales Taxes An ad valorem sales tax levied at a rate of 5% increases all prices by 5%, from $ p $ to $ 1.05 p $ . An ad valorem sales tax levied at a rate of t increases all prices by tp from p to (1+t)p. BC under a uniform sales tax: $ (1+t) p_1 x_1 + (1+t) p_2 x_2 = m $ Do the graph! Exercise: In kind gifts Consumer receives $ g_1 $ units of good one as a gift. Case 1: you can sell (trade) the gift if you want to. Case 2: you cannot sell the gift. Draw the budget line. Exercise: The Food Stamp Program Coupons that can be exchanged only for food. How does a food stamp alter a family\u2019s budget constraint? Suppose $ m = {$}400 $ , $ p_F = {$}1 $ and the price of \u201cother goods\u201d is $ p_G = {$}1 $. The budget constraint is then $ F + G = 400 $ Draw the budget line.

To say something about his/her behavior, we must model decision makers\u2019 preferences. Basics of Preferences Relations John: apple better than Mango, apple better than banana, mango better than banana. Basics of Preferences Relations Al\u00ed, Bob, Carlos, ... , John, ... ,Wei ... Basics of Preferences Relations Preferences are a personal ranking of alternatives. Preferences are a personal assignment of satisfaction level ( utility ). Preferences Relations Preference Relations Comparing two different consumption bundles, $ x $ and $ y $ in the consumption space : Strict preference \"$ x \\succ y $\" : x is strictly more preferred than is y Weak preference \"$ x \\succsim y $\" : x is as at least as preferred as is y Indifference \"$ x \\sim y $\" : x is equally preferred as is y Preference Relations Strict preference ( $ \\succ $ ) , weak preference ( $ \\succsim $ ) and indifference ( $ \\sim $ ) are all preference relations . Binary and ordinal These relations suggest \"feelings\" and predict the behavior we would observe: $ iPhone7 \\succ SGalaxy8 \\rightarrow $ _ ______? $ iPhone7 \\succsim SGalaxy8 \\rightarrow $ _ ______? $ iPhone7 \\sim SGalaxy8 \\rightarrow $ _ ______? Preference Relations They are interlinked $ x \\succsim y $ and $ y \\succsim x $ implies $ x \\sim y $ $ x \\succsim y $ and NOT $ y \\succsim x $ implies $ x \\succ y $ Assumptions on Preference Relations (1): Completeness Completeness : For any two bundles x and y it is always possible to make the statement that either $ x \\succsim y $ or $ y \\succsim x $ Assumptions on Preference Relations (2): Transitivity Transitivity : If x is at least as preferred as y, and y is at least as preferred as z, then: x is at least as preferred as z. That is, if $ x \\succsim y $ and $ y \\succsim z $ implies $ x \\succsim z $ Preferences in the Commodity Space Recap: the Commodity Space is the positive quadrant of the n-dimensional plane ($ \\Re_{+}^n $) where these baskets or bundles live. Indifference Curves or Indifference Sets Indifference Curves or Indifference Sets (of consumer i ): A set of bundles that a consumer regard equally. Take bundle $ x $. The set of all bundles equally preferred to $ x $ makes the \"indifference curve\" containing $ x $. We denote this set by $ I(x) $. All the bundles $ y $ in this set have this property: $ y \\sim x $. Since an indifference \u201ccurve\u201d is not necessarily a \"curve\", we might want to call it indifference \u201cset\u201d . Indifference Curve (example) E.g.: $ (3, 4) \\sim (1, 12) $ Weakly preferred set WP(x) WP(3,4) is the shaded area Assumption on Preferences (3): More is better (monotoniticy) More is Better / Monotonicity: * All else the same, more of a \u201cgood\u201d commodity is better than less. * $ (5.01, 20) \\succ (5, 20) $ Assumption on Preferences (3): More is better (monotoniticy) This assumption implies that indifference sets are: Curves! (not thick bands) Downward sloped! (think about it) Is there only one indifference curve? No! Typically, there are infinite. In most cases it makes sense we talk and draw several (\"the indifference map \"). Goods Vs. Bads Vs. Neutrals Assume $ x_2 $ is a good: more is better. Draw and IC for each case: $ x_1 $ is a good. $ x_1 $ is a bad. $ x_1 $ is a neutral. Home exercise: Can two distinct indifference curves cross each other? Assumption on Preferences (4): Convexity (Weak) Convexity: Mixtures of bundles are (weakly) preferred to the bundles themselves. Example: If the 50-50 mixture of the bundles $ x $ and $ y $ is formed like this $ z = (0.5) x + (0.5)y $. Then $ z $ is at least as preferred as $ x $ OR $ y $. Assumption on Preferences (5): Convexity Assumption on Preferences (5): Convexity Example of preferences that do not satisfy convexity Types of Tastes: Perfect Substitutes If a consumer always regards units of commodities 1 and 2 as equivalent (or equivalent up to a fixed ratio), then these commodities are regarded as perfect substitutes for the consumer. Example: if you like Coke and Pepsi exactly equally, the total amount of bottles is what matter for the consumer. Another example: Agave - Sugar Types of Tastes: Perfect Complements If a consumer always consumes commodities 1 and 2 in fixed proportion (e.g. one-to-one), then the commodities are perfect complements to the consumer. Only the number of pairs in the fixed proportion matter to the consumer. Examples? Slope of an Indifference Curve The slope of an indifference curve is its marginal rate-of-substitution or MRS . MRS is the rate at which the consumer is only just willing to exchange/substitute commodity 2 for a small amount of commodity 1. $ MRS = \\frac{d x_2} {d x_1} $ along one indifference curve. MRS Think about the MRS in Perfect Substitutes Think about the MRS in Perfect Complements","title":"Preferences (Chapter 3)"},{"location":"S3_Preferences_Ch3/#preferences","text":"","title":"Preferences"},{"location":"S3_Preferences_Ch3/#intermediate-microeconomics-econ-100a","text":"","title":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A)"},{"location":"S3_Preferences_Ch3/#kristian-lopez-vargas","text":"","title":"Kristian L\u00f3pez Vargas"},{"location":"S3_Preferences_Ch3/#ucsc-spring-2017","text":"","title":"UCSC - Spring 2017"},{"location":"S3_Preferences_Ch3/#rationality-in-economics-behavioral-postulates","text":"A decision maker knows what he/she likes/enjoys and chooses his/her most preferred alternative among the available ones.

Put differently, if A is preferred to B, then situations suitably close to A must also be preferred to B. Utility Function Main idea: instead of preference relations , we can describe a consumers' preferences using utility functions . Intuition: A utility function assigns a \"satisfaction level\" (a number) to each alternative or bundle. Instead of saying: $ iPhone7 \\succ Galaxy8 $, we say $ U(iPhone7) > U(Galaxy8) $ Instead of saying: $ (2 \\textrm{ Beers}, 3 \\textrm{ Pizzas} ) \\succ (1 \\textrm{ Beers}, 4 \\textrm{ Pizzas} ) $, we say $ U(2, 3) > U(1, 4) $ Utility Function But, how does a preference relations and a utility function connect? If a consumer's preference relations are: complete, transitive, continuous Then, these preferences can be represented by a (continuous) utility function. Note on reflexivity, monotonicity, convexity. Utility Function When do we say that we a utility function represents someone's preference relations? A utility function $ U(x) $ represents a preference relation $ \\succsim $ when: $ x\u2019 \\succ x\u2019\u2019 \\iff U(x\u2019) > U(x\u2019\u2019), ~~ $ for any $ x' $ and $ x'' $ $ x\u2019 \\succsim x\u2019\u2019 \\iff U(x\u2019) \\geq U(x\u2019\u2019) ~~ $, for any $ x' $ and $ x'' $ $ x\u2019 \\sim x\u2019\u2019 \\iff U(x\u2019) = U(x\u2019), ~~ $ for any $ x' $ and $ x'' $ Intuitively, $ U() $ represents a preference relation if it yields the same ranking of alternatives. Utility Function That is, like preference relations, utility is an ordinal (i.e. ordering) concept. If, for example, $ U(x) = 6 $ and $ U(y) = 2 $ then bundle $ x $ is strictly preferred to bundle $ y $. But we cannot say: \" $ x $ is preferred three times as much as is $ y $ \" . Utility Functions & Indifference Curves An indifference curve contains equally preferred bundles. In terms of utility , all bundles in an indifference curve give the same utility level: If $ x \\sim y $, $ \\iff $ $ U(x) = U(y) $. In other words, indifference curves are the level curves of utility functions . Utility Functions & Indiff. Curves - Example! $ u(x_1, x_2) = x_1 ~ x_2 $ Utility Functions & Indifference Curves A more complete collection of indifference curves describes more fully the consumer\u2019s preferences (aka indifference map). Utility functions (are not unique) The preferences of a certain consumer can be described/represented by more than one utility function . That is, there is no unique utility function for a preference relation. Two utility functions $ U() $ and $ V() $ represent the same preferences, if we can obtain $ V() $ by applying a strictly increasing function on $U()$: That is, if we can write $ V = f( U() ) $ where $ f() $ is strictly increasing . [ ask students about strictly increasing functions ] Utility functions (are not unique) - Example 1! Suppose $ U(x_1,x_2) = x_1 x_2 $ represents some preferences. You have bundles $ (4,1), (2,3) $ and $ (2,2) $. Under this utility function: $ U(2,3) = 6 > U(4,1) = U(2,2) = 4 $; Therefore, we know that: $ (2,3) \\succ (4,1) \\sim (2,2) $. Utility functions (are not unique) - Example 1! Suppose we define $ V = U^2 $. Then, $ V(x_1,x_2) = (x_1 x_2)^2 = x_1^2 x_2^2 \\quad $ ...and so, $ V(2,3) = 36 > V(4,1) = V(2,2) = 16 $ SO! again $ (2,3) \\succ (4,1) \\sim (2,2) $. That is, $ V() $ preserves the same order as $ U() $ and therefore represents the same preferences. Utility functions (are not unique) - Example 2! Suppose we define $ W = 2U + 10 $. Then, $ W(x_1,x_2) = 2 (x_1 x_2) + 10 $ ...and so, $ W(2,3) = 22 > W(4,1) = W(2,2) = 18 $ SO! again! $ (2,3) \\succ (4,1) \\sim (2,2) $. That is, $ W() $ preserves the same order as $ U() $ and therefore represents the same preferences. Goods, Bads and Neutrals A good is a commodity unit which increases utility (gives a more preferred bundle). A bad is a commodity unit which decreases utility (gives a less preferred bundle). A neutral is a commodity unit which does not change utility (gives an equally preferred bundle). For home: Draw indifference curves for each of them Drawing an Indifference Curve Identify the utility function: $ U(x_1, x_2) $. Set the utility level to a constant level $ k $: $ U(x_1, x_2) = k $. Solve for $ x_2 $ in the previous equation to obtain a generic indifference curve. Give $ k $ an arbitrary value and draw the curve. To draw another curve, set $ k $ equal to another value and draw again. Drawing an Indifference Curve - Example! Utility: $ U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{0.5} x_2 $ Utility at a constant level: $ x_1^{0.5} x_2 = k $ Solve for $x_2$: $ x_2 = \\frac{k}{x_1^{0.5}} $. Give $ k $ a value: $ x_2 = \\frac{ 10 }{x_1^{0.5}} $. Draw! Give $ k $ another value: $ x_2 = \\frac{ 20 }{x_1^{0.5}} $. Draw! Try with other functions... for example: $ U(x_1, x_2) = x_1 + x_2^{0.5} $ Typical utility fns: perfect substitutes General: $ ~ U(x_1,x_2) = \\alpha x_1 + \\beta x_2 ~~ $, for $ \\alpha, \\beta > 0 $ Example: $ ~ U(x_1,x_2) = x_1 + x_2 $ Typical utility fns: perfect substitutes Typical utility fns: perfect complements General: $ ~ U(x_1,x_2) = \\textrm{min} \\{ \\frac{x_1}{\\alpha}, \\frac{x_2}{\\beta} \\} ~~ $, for $ \\alpha, \\beta > 0 $. Example: $ ~ U = \\textrm{min} \\{ x_1, x_2 \\} ~~ $ Typical utility fns: perfect complements Typical utility fns: Cobb-Douglas General $ U(x_1,x_2) = x_1^a x_2^b $ with $a > 0$ and $b > 0$ Examples: $ U(x_1,x_2) = x_1^{0.5} x_2^{0.5} \\quad $ (that is, $ a = b = 1/2 $) $ U(x_1,x_2) = x_1 x_2^3 \\quad $ (that is, $ a = 1, b = 3 $) $ U(x_1,x_2) = x_1^{2} x_2^{0.75} \\quad $ (that is, $ a = 2, b = 0.75 $) Typical utility fns: Cobb-Douglas Marginal Utility Marginal means \u201cincremental\u201d. The marginal utility of commodity $ x_1 $ is the rate-of-change of total utility as the quantity of commodity $ x_1 $ consumed increases. $ MU_{x_1} = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x_1} $ and $ MU_{x_2} = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x_2} $ To know whether $ MU_{x_1} $ is increasing or decreasing in $ x_1 $, we take the derivative of $ MU_{x_1} $ with respect to $ x_1 $. That is, we calculate: $ \\frac{\\partial MU_{x_1}}{\\partial x_1} $ Marginal Utilities - Cobb-Douglas Example! Utility: $ U(x_1,x_2) = x_1^{0.5} x_2^2 $ Marginal Utilities: $ MU_{x_1} = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x_1} = 0.5 x_1^{-0.5} x_2^2 $ $ MU_{x_2} = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x_2} = 2 x_1^{0.5} x_2^1 $ Marginal Utilities - Perf.

Marginal Utilities and the MRS Claim: $ MRS \\equiv \\frac{d x_2}{d x_1} = - \\frac{ MU_{x_1} }{ MU_{x_2} } $ Here is the math: Remember, the equation for an indifference curve is: $ U(x_1,x_2) = k $, where satisfaction, $ k $, is a constant. Do total differentiation: $ \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x_1} d x_1 + \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x_2} d x_2 = d k $, But $ dk = 0 $ since $ k $ is a constant, and $ \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x_i} $ can be replaced by $ MU_{x_i} $. That is: $ MU_{x_1} d x_1 + MU_{x_2} d x_2 = 0 $ We solve for $ \\frac{d x_2}{d x_1} $ and we get: $ \\frac{d x_2}{d x_1} = - \\frac{ MU_{x_1} }{ MU_{x_2} } $ Marginal Utilities and the MRS - Examples: If $ U = x_1^{2} x_2 $, Then: $ MRS = - \\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = $ $ - \\frac{2 x_1 x_2}{ x_1^2 } = $ $ - 2 \\frac{ x_2 }{ x_1 } $ If $ U = x_1 x_2^{0.5} $, Then: $ MRS = - \\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = $ $ - \\frac{x_2^{0.5}}{ x_1 0.5 x_2^{-0.5}} = $ $ - 2 \\frac{ x_2 }{ x_1 } $ If $ U = x_1 + 5 x_2 $, Then: $ MRS = - 1/5 $","title":"Utility (Chapter 4)"},{"location":"S4_Utility_Ch4/#utility","text":"","title":"Utility"},{"location":"S4_Utility_Ch4/#intermediate-microeconomics-econ-100a","text":"","title":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A)"},{"location":"S4_Utility_Ch4/#kristian-lopez-vargas","text":"","title":"Kristian L\u00f3pez Vargas"},{"location":"S4_Utility_Ch4/#ucsc-spring-2017","text":"","title":"UCSC - Spring 2017"},{"location":"S4_Utility_Ch4/#one-additional-assumption-on-preference-relations","text":"Continuity : A small change in a bundle can only cause small changes to the preference rankings and level.

Utility function (preferences) determine how I value those affordable alternatives. Which bundle do I buy? Consumer's Optimal Choice The bundle with the highest utility among the affordable. We call this bundle the Rational Constrained Choice . Three main cases of Optimal Choice. Tangency Solution: When preferences are well behaved (smooth, convex, ...), then at the optimal bundle: $ MRS = \\frac{\u2212p_1}{p_2} $ (for example Cobb-Douglass preferences) Corner solutions or \"boundary optimum\": if $ MRS > \\frac{\u2212p_1}{p_2} $ or $ MRS < \\frac{\u2212p_1}{p_2} $ always (for example: perfect substitutes) Kink optimality: if preferences are \"kinky\" (for example: perfect complements) Optimal Choice - Tangency Solution Optimal Choice - Tangency Solution (intuitively) Suppose your preferences look like Cobb-Douglass (smooth, convex). You have a BC and you are considering buying $ (x_1', x_2') $ such that $ x_1'>0, x_2'>0 $ on the BC. Suppose that only thing you know is that your MRS, at the bundle $ (x_1', x_2') $, is higher in magnitude than $ p_1 / p_2$. That is, the associated indifference curve is steeper than the budget constraint. Should you buy the bundle $ (x_1', x_2') $? Optimal Choice - Tangency Solution (intuitively) No. If MRS is steeper than BC, it means that at that point you value $ x_1 $ more than the market. So... Buy more of that good 1. But how much more? Up to a point in which you and the market value $ x_1 $ the same (relative to $ x_2 $) First optimality condition: $ MRS = \\frac{\u2212p_1}{p_2} $ Optimal Choice - Tangency Solution (math method 1) Steps to find the optimal bundle (aka the demanded bundle) for tangency cases: Identify clearly the utility function. Calculate the $ MRS $, it will be a function of $ x_1, x_2 $ and (possibly) on some parameters of the utility function. Set the tangency condition: $ MRS = - \\frac{p_1}{p_2} $ call this Equation 1. Identify the budget constrain and call it Equation 2. Equation 1 and Equation 2 form a 2-equation-2-unknowns system, so you can solve for the two unknowns: $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $. Optimal Choice - Tangency Solution (math method 1) - Example Let's apply these steps to the case of Cobb-Douglas preferences: $ U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{0.5} x_2^{0.5} $ Tangency : $ MRS = - \\frac{x_2}{x_1} $. Equate MRS to: $ - \\frac{p_1}{p_2} $ (Eq1) Budget constraint : $ p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 = m $ (Eq2) [ solve for x1 and x2 in the system of two equations -- details in doc camera ] Optimal bundle: $ x_1^{*} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m}{p_1} $ and $ x_2^{*} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{m}{p_2} $ Optimal Choice - Tangency Solution - Cobb-Douglas Function Note if you have Cobb-Douglass utility, $ U = x_1^{a} x_2^{b} $, you can always use method 1. Exercise: apply method 1 to this utility function: $ U = x_1^{a} x_2^{b} $ An alternative to method 1, is a more general method called the Lagrange Method that we will cover later. Cobb-Douglas - Typical Graph Case 2: Optimal bundle in corner solutions The most typical case of this type of solution is with perfect substitutes preferences. Steps to finding the optimal bundle when x_1 and x_2 are perfect substitutes : Calculate the $ MRS $, it will be a function of $ x_1, x_2 $ and (possibly) on some parameters of the utility function. Compare its magnitude to the price ratio: $ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} $. If $ |MRS| > \\frac{p_1}{p_2} $, then all income is spent on good 1: $ x_1 = m / p_1 $ and $ x_2 = 0 $ If $ |MRS| < \\frac{p_1}{p_2} $, then all income is spent on good 2: $ x_2 = m / p_2 $ and $ x_1 = 0 $ If $ |MRS| = \\frac{p_1}{p_2} $ any bundle that exhaust income will be optimal. Finding the optimal bundle (perfect substitutes) - Example! Say, $ u = 2 x_1 + x_2 $ $ MRS = - 2 / 1 = - 2 $ Compare |MRS| to price ratio: 2 vs. $ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} $. If $ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} < 2 $, then: $ x_1 = m / p_1 $ and $ x_2 = 0 $ If $ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} > 2 $, then: $ x_1 = 0 $ and $ x_2 = m / p_2 $ If $ \\frac{p_1}{p_2} = 2 $, any $ (x_1, x_2) $ such that $ p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 = m $ is optimal. Perfect substitutes See graphs in document camera See graphs on EconGraphs Case 3: Optimal bundle in \"kink\" solutions Most cases of \"kink\" solutions appear because of \"perfect complement\" preferences. Steps to find the optimal bundle under \"perfect complement\" preferences: Identify clearly the utility function: $ U = \\textrm{min} \\{ \\frac{x_1}{\\alpha}, \\frac{x_2}{\\beta} \\} $, for $ \\alpha, \\beta > 0 $ Calculate the optimal consumption path : $ \\frac{x_1}{\\alpha} = \\frac{x_2}{\\beta} $. Call this Equation 1. Identify the budget constraint and call it Equation 2. Equation 1 and Equation 2 form a 2-equation-2-unknowns system, so you can solve for the two unknowns: $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $. Finding the optimal bundle - Perfect complements - Numerical Example $ U = \\textrm{min} \\{ \\frac{x_1}{2}, x_2 \\} $. Optimal consumption path : $ \\frac{x_1}{2} = x_2 $. This is Equation 1. Budget Constraint $ m = p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 $ Optimal bundle: $ x_1^{*} = \\frac{m}{p_1 + p_2/2} $ and $ x_2^{*} = \\frac{m}{2 p_1 + p_2} $ Perfect Complements Optimal choice with Lagrange's Method We are back to case 1 or \"tangency solution\". Conditions: Utility function is differentiable and preferences are convex, $ MRS(0,y) = infinity $ and $ MRS(x,0) = 0 $ E.g. Cobb-Douglas satisfies these conditions. You can always use the Lagrange's method. Optimal choice with Lagrange's Method - Steps Set Problem: $ \\textrm{maximize} \\quad U(x_1, x_2) $ subject to: $ m = p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 $ Write Lagrange's function $ L = U(x_1, x_2) - \\lambda ( p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 - m) $ Differentiate with respect to $ x_1, x_2, \\lambda $, equate to zero. $ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_1} = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x_1} - \\lambda p_1 = 0 $ $ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x_2} - \\lambda p_2 = 0 $ $ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda} = - p_1 x_1 - p_2 x_2 + m = 0 $ Solve system of three equations. Optimal choice with Lagrange's Method - Example Consider: $ \\quad U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{0.5} + x_2^{0.5} $ Problem: $ \\quad \\textrm{maximize} \\quad x_1^{0.5} + x_2^{0.5} $ subject to: $ m = p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 $ Lagrange's function: $ \\quad L = x_1^{0.5} + x_2^{0.5} - \\lambda ( p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 - m) $ Differentiate with respect to $ x_1, x_2, \\lambda $, equate to zero. $ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_1} = 0.5 x_1^{-0.5} - \\lambda p_1 = 0 $ $ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_2} = 0.5 x_2^{-0.5} - \\lambda p_2 = 0 $ $ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda} = - p_1 x_1 - p_2 x_2 + m = 0 $ Solution good 1: $ \\quad x_1^* = \\frac{ m }{ p_1 + p_2 } \\frac{ p_2 }{ p_1 } $ Solution good 2: $ \\quad x_2^* = \\frac{ m }{ p_1 + p_2 } \\frac{ p_1 }{ p_2 } $ Practice all these cases with the lagrange's Method. $ U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{1/2} x_2^{1/2} $ $ U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{1/4} x_2^{3/4} $ => $ U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{a} x_2^{b} $ $ U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^{a} x_2^{1-a} $ $ U(x_1, x_2) = (1/4) ln(x_1) + (3/4) ln(x_2) $ $ U(x_1, x_2) = a x_1 + b ln(x_2) $ Tangency does not work with non-convex preferences Be careful with tangency conditions.

How much can you reduce K ( $ - \\Delta K $ ) such that production level is not altered? Mathematically, TSR is the derivative of K with respect to L, along one isoquant curve: $ TRS = \\frac{ dK }{ dL } = - \\frac{ MP_L }{ MP_K } $ Examples: do Cobb-Douglas and linear production. Diminishing marginal product / returns Diminishing marginal returns : More of a single input produces more output, but at a decreasing rate: Example: $ q = f(L, K) = L^{0.5} K^2 $ Diminishing TRS equivalent to convexity. (!) There is a difference between diminishing returns (MPs) and diminishing TRS (!) Example: $ q = L \\times K $ $ MP_L $ is not diminishing but $ TRS $ is decreasing.

Returns to scale - definition Production function exhibits: Constant returns to scale (CRS): when a percentage increase in inputs is followed by the same percentage increase in output. Example: doubling inputs doubles output: $ f(2L, 2K) = 2f(L, K) $ Increasing returns to scale (IRS): when a percentage increase in inputs is followed by a larger percentage increase in output. Example: $ f(2L, 2K) > 2f(L, K) $ Decreasing returns to scale (DRS): when a percentage increase in inputs is followed by a smaller percentage increase in output. Example: $ f(2L, 2K) < 2f(L, K) $ Returns to scale - intuition Some technologies allow for proportional scaling up of your production operation. Some other technologies do not. Why? CRS: Easy replication (e.g. flyer distribution, data centers. Think of other examples) IRS: Occurs often with greater specialization of L and K (e.g. a larger plant more productive than two small plants). DRS: Occurs often because of the difficulty in organizing/coordinating/ searching activities as firm size increases (e.g. mining). Returns to scale - the math For $ t>1 $, the production function $ f(L,K) $ exhibits CRS/IRS/DRS when: CRS: $ f(tL,tK) = t f(L,K) $ IRS: $ f(tL,tK) > t f(L,K) $ DRS: $ f(tL,tK) < t f(L,K) $ Returns to scale - examples $ q = f(L, K) = L + K $ $ q = f(L, K) = L \\times K^2 $ $ q = f(L) = L^{0.5} $ $ q = f(L, K) = min \\{ L , K/2 \\} $ Returns to scale - graphics Returns to scale - local notion \"Returns to scale\" are a local notion! Some prod functions have \"global\" returns to scale (e.g. $ q = L K $ ), but not all. Example: $ q = f(L,K) = (L+K) + (K+L)^2 - 0.1 (K+L)^3 $ Start at $ (L, K) = (0.5 , 0.5) $ Try scaling inputs up by $ t=2 $ Try scaling inputs up by $ t=10 $ try set t=2 and then t=10 in this desmos example Long run and short run of the firm If all factors can be adjusted, the firm is in the \"long run\" If at least one factor cannot be adjusted, the firm is in the \"short run\" That is, we are in the short run (SR) when some factor(s) must stay fixed. Typically, we hold $ K $ constant at level $ \\bar{K} $ in the SR.

Late assignments will not be accepted. Only four randomly-chosen questions will be graded. It is graded out of 100 points and 5 points will be subtracted if you do not staple your homework. Question 1: You're waiting to board at an airport for a trip to Korea. You decided to buy cigarettes and Swiss chocolates for your friends at a shop in the airport. You have ${$}$30 only. A price for one pack of cigarettes is ${$}$2 and a price for one bar of Swiss chocolates is ${$}$3. You also learned from a traveller's book that you can only bring 10 packs of cigarettes into the country at the maximum and are not allowed to buy more than that $($\"cigarettes rationing\"). Write down the budget set and budget line in equations for the case without regulation on cigarettes amount. Draw a budget line for each of two cases in a same graph: without the regulation on cigarettes amount and with the regulation in place. Put Swiss chocolates on the $y$ axis and cigarettes on the $x$ axis. Label $x$ and $y$ intercepts. Suppose the price of a bar of Swiss chocolates increases to ${$}$4 due to an increase in cocoa powder. Draw a new budget line with the cigarettes rationing under the new price in the same graph. Can you afford an bundle $($cigarettes = 7 packs, chocolates = 5 bars$)$ under the old price of chocolates $($i.e. $p_2 = 3$ $)$? How about under the new price of chocolates $($i.e. $p_2 = 4$ $)$? Solutions. Budget set: $$Cigarettes \\times p_1 + Chocolates \\times p_2 \\leq 30$$ Budget line:$$Cigarettes \\times p_1 + Chocolates \\times p_2 = 30$$ See the graph below. See the graph below. $7 \\times 2 + 5 \\times 3 = 14 + 15 = 29 < 30 \\implies$ affordable $7 \\times 2 + 5 \\times 4 = 14 + 20 = 34 > 30 \\implies$ unaffordable Question 2: A consumer has an income of ${$}$1,000 to spend on food and medicine. The price of one unit of food is ${$}$5 and the price of one unit of medicine is ${$}$10. For each question, write down the mathematical expression of the budget constraint and draw it carefully. Put food on the x-axis and medicine on the y-axis. Label the incercepts, slopes, and kinks. Suppose the consumer receives coupons for 50 units of food and those can only be used to buy food. Suppose the consumer receives coupons for 50 units of food and can sell the coupons at half of the market price of the food. Instead of the coupon, the consumer receives a 20% discount for additional units of food that exceed 100 units. That is, the consumer pays ${$}$5 for each of the first 100 units and ${$}$4 for each additional unit. Solutions. Suppose the consumer receives coupons for 50 units of food and those can only be used to buy food. $$\\begin{align} x_2 &= 100 &\\text{ if } x_1 \\leq 50 \\\\ x_2 &= - 0.5 x_1 + 125 \\text{ or } 5 x_1 + 10 x_2 = 1250 &\\text{ if } x_1 > 50 \\end{align}$$ Suppose the consumer receives coupons for 50 units of food and can sell the coupons at half of the market price of the food. $$\\begin{align} x_2 &= -0.25 x_1 + 112.5 &\\text{ or } &2.5 x_1 + 10 x_2 = 1125 &\\text{ if } x_1 \\leq 50 \\\\ x_2 &= - 0.5 x_1 + 125 &\\text{ or } &5 x_1 + 10 x_2 = 1250 &\\text{ if } x_1 > 50 \\end{align} $$ Long explanation : Suppose you consume $x_1$ units of good 1 such that $x_1 > 50$. What is your expenditure on good1? It is not ${$}5 \\times x_1$ because you don't actually pay for the 50 units of those. Your expenditure on good 1 will be ${$}5 \\times (x_1-50) $. For example, if you consume 60 units of $x_1$, your expenditure is $(60-50)\\times 5 = 50 $. Your expenditure on good 2 is still $ 10 \\times x_2 $. Combining it together, we have: $$\\begin{align} 5(x_1-50) + 10x_2 &= 1000 \\\\ 5x_1 - 250 + 10x_2 &= 1000 \\\\ 5x_1 + 10x_2 &= 1250 \\end{align} $$ As you can see from the first line, your income is still 1,000. It is not that your income increased to 1,250. Consider the case when $x_1 \\leq 50$. If you consume exactly 50 units of good1, then you use all 50 coupons. However, if you want to consume less than 50 units of good 1, you don't need all 50 coupons. In fact, you will want to sell it if you are allowed to $($e.g. you are not allowed to in Q2.1$)$. Hence, the price that matters is the price at which you can sell the coupons $(=2.5)$, not the price at which you are buying good 1. Since the budget line expresses expenditure as positive numbers, earnings must be expressed as negative numbers. For example, if you consume 49 units of good1, you earn ${$}$2.5, which can be expressed as $2.5(49-50) = -2.5$. In sum, your budget line is: $$\\begin{align} 2.5(x_1-50) + 10x_2 &= 1000 \\\\ 2.5x_1 - 125 + 10x_2 &= 1000 \\\\ 2.5x_1 + 10x_2 &= 1125 \\end{align} $$ Instead of the coupon, the consumer receives a 20% discount for additional units of food that exceed 100 units. That is, the consumer pays ${$}$5 for each of the first 100 units and ${$}$4 for each additional unit. $$ \\begin{align} x_2 &= -0.5 x_1 + 100 &\\text{ or } &5 x_1 + 10 x_2 = 1000 &\\text{ if } x_1 \\leq 100 \\\\ x_2 &= - 0.4 x_1 + 90 &\\text{ or } &4 x_1 + 10 x_2 = 900 &\\text{ if } x_1 > 100 \\end{align} $$ Longer explanation: You know there are two prices depending on the amount of food you consume: 5 dollars if you consume 100 or less, and 4 dollars for units above 100 units of food. That implies the budget line will have two segments with two different slopes: for $ x_1 \\leq 100 $ , $ \\frac{-p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{-5}{10} $ ; and for $ x_1 > 100 $ , $ \\frac{-p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{-4}{10} $. Therefore it only remains for us to determine the intercepts of the budget constraint and the exact point at which slope changes. $ x_2 $ intercept is 100, because $ m/p_2 = 100 $, because that is all you can buy of x_2 with 1000 dollars. $ x_1 $ intercept is more interesting: the first 100 units cost 5 dollars times 100 units = 500 dollars, leaving 500 dollars of your income available. With those 500 dollars you can buy food units at four dollars. So you can buy additional 125 units of food. The most of food you can achieve therefore is 225 units (100+125). Also the exact point of change of slope is (100,50), because 50 that is the most you can buy of x_2 if you also buy exactly 100 units of x_1. That is all you need to draw the budget line. But if you want an equation for each segment you can proceed to the next point. There are many (in fact, infinite) ways to express a segment of a line. Here I give you just one. For the first segment ($ x_1 \\leq 100 $), we know the intercept and the slope so that one is immediate: $ x_2 = intercept + slope ~ x_1 = 100 + (-5/10) x_1 $ (which can also be written as: $ 5 x_1 + 10 x_2 = 1000 $). For the second segment ($ x_1 > 100 $), we do not know the intercept but we can find it. We know that its slope is -(4/10) and that it passes through the point (100,50) so it must be that: $ 50 = intercept + (-4/10) ~ 100 $. So $ intercept = 90 $. So the line segment is $ x_2 = 90 + (-4/10) x_1 $ (which can also be written as: $ 4 x_1 + 10 x_2 = 900 $). Please understand that this does not mean that the income is 900 dollars; this is just an equation that represents the line segment we want. Question 3: This question allows you to evaluate how to think about the welfare of consumers. Assume a consumer's welfare is driven by what he/she consumes. Suppose there are only two types of goods to consume: food and leisure. An average Californian citizen has a daily income of ${$}$100. The price of one meal of food is ${$}$20 and the price $($or value$)$ of one unit of leisure is ${$}$10. An average citizen in Mississippi has a daily income of ${$}$50. The price of one unit of food is ${$}$10 and the price $($or value$)$ of one unit of leisure is ${$}$10. Who is more well-off in terms of the bundles of goods they can consume? $($hint: draw budget sets.$)$ Suppose you earn ${$}$100 per day. One day your boss increases your income by 50% solely due to your high performance at work. Are you more well-off, worse-off, the same, or cannot answer compared to before the change? Suppose the boss had lied to you. The reason why she increased your salary by 50% is because all other prices also increased by 50%. Are you more well-off, worse-off, the same, or cannot answer compared to before the change? Suppose you are a big fan of Japanese food and Chinese food and those are the only two goods you consume. Suppose your income does not change and the price of Japanese food decreases. However, the price of Chinese food increases. Are you more well-off, worse-off, the same, or cannot answer compared to before the changes in prices? Solutions. The budget line for a representative person living in Californian is $$ meal \\times 20 + leisure \\times 10 = 100\\\\ meal \\times 1 + leisure \\times 0.5 = 5 $$ and the budget line for a representative person living in Mississippi is $$ meal \\times 10 + leisure \\times 10 = 50\\\\ meal \\times 1 + leisure \\times 1 = 5\\\\ $$ Since the budget set of a person in Mississippi is inside of the budget set of a person living in California, the person is California is more well-off than the person in Mississippi in terms of the amount of food and leisure that can be consumed. Well-off because you can afford more of every good. The budget set is wider. The same because you can afford just as much as before. The budget set did not change. We cannot answer without more information. It depends on which food you like more than the other which can be represented by an indifference curve. Question 4: Answer the following questions regarding preferences: 4.1. Suppose you have two distinct bundles $ X $ and $ Y $, and, for you, $ X $ is strictly better than $ Y $. Explain briefly using a graph and words why the two indifference curves associated to two bundles $X$ and $Y$ (I(X) and I(Y)) cannot cross each other. 4.2. Explain using a graph and words why if the assumption of monotonic preferences $($aka \u201cmore-is-better\u201d$)$ implies that indifference curves are not thick and they must be downward sloped. 4.3. Provide three examples of goods that are typically regarded as perfect substitutes. Explain briefly. 4.4. Provide three examples of goods that are typically regarded as perfect complements. Explain briefly. Solutions. From textbook, \"To prove this, let us choose three bundles of goods, X, Y , and Z, such that X lies only on one indifference curve, Y lies only on the other indifference curve, and Z lies at the intersection of the indifference curves. By assumption the indifference curves represent distinct levels of preference, so one of the bundles, say X, is strictly preferred to the other bundle, Y . We know that X $\\sim$ Z and Z $\\sim$ Y , and the axiom of transitivity therefore implies that X $\\sim$ Y . But this contradicts the assumption that X $\\succ$ Y . This contradiction establishes the result\u2014indifference curves representing distinct levels of preference cannot cross.'' Thick indifference curve : Suppose the monotonicity holds even with the thick indifference curve. In the graph, the bundle X has more of good 1 and good 2 than than bundle Y, but the thick indifference curve implies that the bundle X is equally preferred to Y. This contradicts with the monotonicity assumption. Downward sloping : Consider the indifference curve that is not downward sloping. By the definition of indifference curve, B is equally preferred to A. However, this again violates the monotonicity assumption because B has more of good 1 and more of good 2. Example1 : a consumer choosing between a blue pen and black pen who doesn't care about color. Example2 : a consumer choosing between a coke and a pepsi who cannot tell the difference. Example3 : a consumer choosing between an organic milk with 1% fat produced by farm A and an organic milk with 1% fat produced by farm B. Example1 : a consumer who drinks a cup of coffee only with 2 teaspoons sugar. Example2 : the number of left shoes and right shoes for a consumer who can only use pairs of shoes. Example3 : the number of nuts and bolts. Question 5: For each of the following functions, i) pick three utility levels and draw the precise indifference curves that are associated with the levels of your choice, ii) label the utility level of the lines -- you cannot just draw random lines and assign arbitrary utility levels, and iii) give the name of preferences they represent ( hint : see figures in textbook chapter 3). $u(x_1,x_2) = x_1 + x_2$ $u(x_1,x_2) = min(x_1, x_2)$ $u(x_1,x_2) = x_1$ $u(x_1,x_2) = x_1 - x_2$ $u(x_1,x_2) = \\sqrt{x_1 x_2}$ $u(x_1,x_2) = -${$(x_1 - 3)^2 + (x_2 - 2)^2$} Solutions.

Also assume that $ x,y > 0 $. 7.1. Derive the marginal utility of $x$ and the marginal utility of $y$ and state whether or not the assumption that more is better is satisfied for both goods. 7.2. Does the marginal utility of $x$ diminish, remain constant, or increase as the consumer buys more $x$? What does it mean in words? 7.3. What is $MRS_{x,y}$? 7.4. Suppose $a,b = \\frac{1}{2}$. What is $MRS$ at $(x,y) = (1,4)$ and what does it mean in words? What is $MRS$ at $(x,y) = (4,1)$ and what does it mean in words? 7.5. Continue assuming $a,b = \\frac{1}{2}$. Draw two indifference curves of the utility function. To get full credit, draw one with the level of utility 2 and the other with the level of utility 3. For each indifference curve, label at least one point on the curve. 7.6. Draw tangent lines at $ (x,y) = (1,4) $ and $ (x,y) = (4,1) $ in the same graph and label the slopes you solved in $ MRS(1,4) $ and $ MRS(4,1) $. Solutions. $MU_x = ax^{a-1}y^b > 0$ and $MU_y = bx^{a}y^{b-1} > 0$. Since an increase in $x$,$y$ increases utility, ''more is better'' assumption is satisfied. The derivative of $MU_x$ $($ or second derivative of $U(x_1,x_2)$ $)$: $$ \\frac{\\partial MU_x}{\\partial x} = a(a-1)x^{a-2}y^b < 0 $$ Since $0<a<1$, marginal utility of $x$ is decreasing. It means additional unit of good $x$ gives less and less utility as the consumer consumes more. $MRS(x,y) = \\frac{d y}{d x} = - \\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} = -\\frac{ax^{a-1}y^b}{bx^{a}y^{b-1}} = -\\frac{a}{b}\\frac{y}{x}$ $MRS(1,4) = -4$ and $MRS(4,1) = -0.25$. The MRS measures the amount of good 2 that one is willing to give up for a marginal amount of extra consumption of good 1. When the consumer is consuming a bundle $(1,4)$, he is willing to pay four units of good 2 for a little more of good 1. When the consumer is consuming a bundle $(4,1)$, he is willing to pay 0.25 units of good 2 for a little more of good 1. He is now willing to pay much less of good 2 because he now has more of good 1. See the graph below. See the graph below. Question 8: 8.1. Consider a transformation of the utility function in Question 7 using $ u' = ln (u) $. In other words, the new utility function $ u' = ln (u) = ln(x^{a}y^{b}) = a \\times ln(x) + b \\times ln(y) $. What is $MRS_{x,y}$ of this new utility function? Is it the same as or different from $MRS_{x,y}$ you found in Q7.3? Explain. 8.2. Will the MRS be still the same for each of the following transformation? Explain without directly solving for MRS. a). $u' = u^2$ b). $u' = 1/u^2$ c). $u' = 1987 \\times u - 507$ d). $u' = e^u$ 8.3. Explain why taking a monotonic transformation of a utility function does not change the marginal rate of substitution (MRS). Solutions. $MRS(x,y) = -\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} = - \\frac{\\frac{a}{x}}{\\frac{b}{y}} = -\\frac{a}{b}\\frac{y}{x}.$ This is equal to the MRS in Q7.3. MRS will be the same for a transformation that is strictly increasing. We know that linear transformation with a positive slope - c) and exponential function - d) are strictly increasing. For a) and b), the MRS will not be the same because they are not strictly increasing. For a), a counter example is that $2 > -3$, but $f(2) < f(-3)$, reversing the order. For b), a counter example is $2 > 1$, but $f(2) < f(1)$, reversing the order. A monotonic transformation preserves the ranking of bundles, hence preferences. Since MRS is determined by preferences, it does not change.","title":"Hw1 solutions"},{"location":"hw1_solutions/#homework-assignment-1","text":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A) Kristian L\u00f3pez Vargas UCSC - Spring 2017 Due on Friday 14 Apr 2017 Homework assignments will be turned-in on paper, at the beginning of the corresponding lecture.

What is your expenditure on good1? It is not ${$}5 \\times x_1$ because you don't actually pay for the 50 units of those. Your expenditure on good 1 will be ${$}5 \\times (x_1-50) $. For example, if you consume 60 units of $x_1$, your expenditure is $(60-50)\\times 5 = 50 $. Your expenditure on good 2 is still $ 10 \\times x_2 $. Combining it together, we have: $$\\begin{align} 5(x_1-50) + 10x_2 &= 1000 \\\\ 5x_1 - 250 + 10x_2 &= 1000 \\\\ 5x_1 + 10x_2 &= 1250 \\end{align} $$ As you can see from the first line, your income is still 1,000. It is not that your income increased to 1,250. Consider the case when $x_1 \\leq 50$. If you consume exactly 50 units of good1, then you use all 50 coupons. However, if you want to consume less than 50 units of good 1, you don't need all 50 coupons. In fact, you will want to sell it if you are allowed to $($e.g. you are not allowed to in Q2.1$)$. Hence, the price that matters is the price at which you can sell the coupons $(=2.5)$, not the price at which you are buying good 1. Since the budget line expresses expenditure as positive numbers, earnings must be expressed as negative numbers. For example, if you consume 49 units of good1, you earn ${$}$2.5, which can be expressed as $2.5(49-50) = -2.5$. In sum, your budget line is: $$\\begin{align} 2.5(x_1-50) + 10x_2 &= 1000 \\\\ 2.5x_1 - 125 + 10x_2 &= 1000 \\\\ 2.5x_1 + 10x_2 &= 1125 \\end{align} $$ Instead of the coupon, the consumer receives a 20% discount for additional units of food that exceed 100 units. That is, the consumer pays ${$}$5 for each of the first 100 units and ${$}$4 for each additional unit. $$ \\begin{align} x_2 &= -0.5 x_1 + 100 &\\text{ or } &5 x_1 + 10 x_2 = 1000 &\\text{ if } x_1 \\leq 100 \\\\ x_2 &= - 0.4 x_1 + 90 &\\text{ or } &4 x_1 + 10 x_2 = 900 &\\text{ if } x_1 > 100 \\end{align} $$ Longer explanation: You know there are two prices depending on the amount of food you consume: 5 dollars if you consume 100 or less, and 4 dollars for units above 100 units of food. That implies the budget line will have two segments with two different slopes: for $ x_1 \\leq 100 $ , $ \\frac{-p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{-5}{10} $ ; and for $ x_1 > 100 $ , $ \\frac{-p_1}{p_2} = \\frac{-4}{10} $. Therefore it only remains for us to determine the intercepts of the budget constraint and the exact point at which slope changes. $ x_2 $ intercept is 100, because $ m/p_2 = 100 $, because that is all you can buy of x_2 with 1000 dollars. $ x_1 $ intercept is more interesting: the first 100 units cost 5 dollars times 100 units = 500 dollars, leaving 500 dollars of your income available. With those 500 dollars you can buy food units at four dollars. So you can buy additional 125 units of food. The most of food you can achieve therefore is 225 units (100+125). Also the exact point of change of slope is (100,50), because 50 that is the most you can buy of x_2 if you also buy exactly 100 units of x_1. That is all you need to draw the budget line. But if you want an equation for each segment you can proceed to the next point. There are many (in fact, infinite) ways to express a segment of a line. Here I give you just one. For the first segment ($ x_1 \\leq 100 $), we know the intercept and the slope so that one is immediate: $ x_2 = intercept + slope ~ x_1 = 100 + (-5/10) x_1 $ (which can also be written as: $ 5 x_1 + 10 x_2 = 1000 $). For the second segment ($ x_1 > 100 $), we do not know the intercept but we can find it. We know that its slope is -(4/10) and that it passes through the point (100,50) so it must be that: $ 50 = intercept + (-4/10) ~ 100 $. So $ intercept = 90 $. So the line segment is $ x_2 = 90 + (-4/10) x_1 $ (which can also be written as: $ 4 x_1 + 10 x_2 = 900 $). Please understand that this does not mean that the income is 900 dollars; this is just an equation that represents the line segment we want.","title":"Solutions."},{"location":"hw1_solutions/#question-3","text":"This question allows you to evaluate how to think about the welfare of consumers.

It means additional unit of good $x$ gives less and less utility as the consumer consumes more. $MRS(x,y) = \\frac{d y}{d x} = - \\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} = -\\frac{ax^{a-1}y^b}{bx^{a}y^{b-1}} = -\\frac{a}{b}\\frac{y}{x}$ $MRS(1,4) = -4$ and $MRS(4,1) = -0.25$. The MRS measures the amount of good 2 that one is willing to give up for a marginal amount of extra consumption of good 1. When the consumer is consuming a bundle $(1,4)$, he is willing to pay four units of good 2 for a little more of good 1. When the consumer is consuming a bundle $(4,1)$, he is willing to pay 0.25 units of good 2 for a little more of good 1. He is now willing to pay much less of good 2 because he now has more of good 1.

Question 1: Luke's choice behavior can be represented by the utility function $u(x_1,x_2) = x_1 + x_2$. The prices of $x_1$ and $x_2$ are denoted as $p_1$ and $p_2$, and his income is $m$.

Find the optimal bundle $(x^{*}_1,x^{*}_2)$ as a function of income and prices. Draw a budget constraint assuming that $p_1 = p_2$. Find the optimal bundle $(x^{*}_1,x^{*}_2)$ as a function of income and prices. Solutions: $MRS_{x,y} = -\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} = -1$. The slope is constant, and not changing as we can see from the indifference curve map. See the graph below. The optimal bundle is $(x^{*}_1,x^{*}_2) = \\frac{m}{p_1}, 0$. See the graph below. The optimal bundle is $(x^{*}_1,x^{*}_2) = 0, \\frac{m}{p_2}$. See the graph below. The optimal bundle is $(x^{*}_1,x^{*}_2)$ such that $p_1 \\times x^{*}_1 + p_2 \\times x^{*}_2 = m$. Question 2: Lorelai's choice behavior can be represented by the utility function $$ u(x_1,x_2) = 0.9ln(x_1)+ 0.1x_2.$$ The prices of both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are ${$}$5 and she has an income of ${$}$40.

Set the preferences and parameters accordingly as given in the question. Click on \"snap to optimal bundle'' to see the optimal choice. Click on \"show indifference curve map.\" Draw the lowest four indifference curves as you see from the graph. Find the marginal utility of $x_1$ and $x_2$. What is the maximum number of $x_1$ so that $MU_{x_1}$ is bigger than or equal to $MU_{x_2}$? Given her income of ${$}$40, how many units of $x_1$ can she buy? Would she buy any positive number of $x_2$ in light of the answer from Q2.3? Find the optimal bundle. Suppose instead her income is ${$}$50. Would she buy any positive number of $x_2$? Find the optimal bundle using the tangency condition. Find the optimal bundle with an income of ${$}$100 using the tangency condition. What happens to the consumption amount of $x_1$ compared to the consumption of $x_1$ with an income of ${$}$50? $($Hint: In econgraphs , play around by moving an income slide bar and see how the optimal bundle changes.$)$ Will the optimal bundle be the same or different if the utility function were $u(x_1,x_2) = 9 ln(x_1) + x_2$? What if the utility function were $u(x_1,x_2) = x_1^9 \\times exp(x_2)$? Explain. Solutions: This is a quasilinear utility function which represents quasilinear preferences. See the graph below. $MU_{x_1} = \\frac{0.9}{x_1}$ and $MU_{x_2} = 0.1$. $MU_{x_1}$ is greater than or equal to $MU_{x_2}$ only if $x_1 \\leq 9$. When the income is 40, Lorelai can buy 8 units of good 1 at which point the marginal utility of good 1 is still higher than the marginal utility of consuming good 2. Hence, she wants to spend all of her income on good $x_1$ and nothing on $x_2$. In other words, $x^{*}_1 = \\frac{m}{p_1} = \\frac{40}{5} = 8 $ and $x^{*}_2 = 0$. When the income is 50, Lorelai can buy 10 units of good 1 at which point the marginal utility of good 1 is lower than the marginal utility of consuming good 2. In other words, she will be better off by reducing the consumption of good 1 in exchange for good 2. That means the solution is not any more at the boundary. Hence, we can solve this using tangency condition. Tangency condition says the MRS evaluated at $(x^{*}_1, x^{*}_2)$ is equal to the negative of price ratio, $ -\\frac{p_1}{p_2} $. The MRS is: $$ MRS(x_1,x_2) = - \\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = -\\frac{\\frac{0.9}{x_1}}{0.1} = -\\frac{9}{x_1}.$$ Since the price ratio is 1, the tangency condition is $\\frac{9}{x^{*}_1} = 1$. This gives $x^{*}_1 = 9$. Now use the equality of budget constraint to solve for $x^{*}_2$: $$ 5\\times x^{*}_1 + 5\\times x^{*}_2 = 50 \\implies 5 \\times 9 + 5\\times x^{*}_2 = 50 \\implies x^{*}_2 = 1 $$ 6. As we've seen in the previous question, income does not enter the tangency condition, $\\frac{9}{x^{*}_1} = 1$. Hence ${x^{*}_1}$ is still 9. Now using the equality of budget constraint: $$ 5\\times x^{*}_1 + 5\\times x^{*}_2 = 100 \\implies 5 \\times 9 + 5\\times x^{*}_2 = 100 \\implies x^{*}_2 = 11 $$ A characteristic of quasilinear preference is that, when income is large enough, an extra increase in income is spent only one good $(x_2)$ in which the utility is linear. 7. We can obtain the old utility function by multiplying the first utility function by $0.1$ and by taking a log transformation for the second utility function. Since they are both monotonic transformation, it preserves the preferences and the optimal bundle as well. Question 3: Paris has a utility function over berries $($denoted by $B$ $)$ and chocolate $($denoted by $C$ $)$ as follows: $$ U(B,C) = \\frac{1}{3} ln(B) + \\frac{2}{3} ln(C) $$ The price of berries and chocolate is $p_B$ and $p_C$, respectively. Paris's income is $m$. What preferences does this utility function represent? Find the $MRS_{BC}$ as a function of $B$ and $C$ assuming $B$ is on the x-axis. Find the optimal bundle B and C as a function of income and prices using the tangency condition. What is the fraction of total expenditure spent on berries and chocolate out of total income, respectively? Now suppose Paris has an income of ${$}$300. The price of a container of berries is ${$}$5 and the price of a chocolate bar is ${$}$4. Find the numerical answers for the optimal bundle, by plugging the numbers into the solution you found in Q3.3. Solutions: It is a log transformation of $U(B,C) = B^{1/3} C^{2/3}$, which we know represents Cobb-Douglas preferences. Since log is a strictly increasing function, it represents the same preferences, Cobb-Douglas. $$ MRS_{BC} = -\\frac{MU_B}{MU_C} = - \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{1}{B}}{\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{1}{C}} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{C}{B}.$$ Tangency condition: $$ \\frac{C}{2B} = \\frac{p_B}{p_C} \\implies C = \\frac{p_B}{p_C} 2B $$ Plug it into the Budget constraint: $$ p_B B + p_C C = m \\implies p_B B + p_C \\Big(\\frac{p_B}{p_C} 2B \\Big) = m \\\\ \\implies p_B B + 2 p_B B = m \\implies 3B = \\frac{m}{p_B} \\implies B = \\frac{m}{3p_B} \\\\ \\implies C = \\frac{p_B}{p_C} 2B = \\frac{p_B}{p_C} 2 \\Big(\\frac{m}{3p_B}\\Big) = \\frac{2m}{3p_C} $$ Answers:$$ B^{*}(m,p_B) = \\frac{m}{3p_B} \\\\ C^{*}(m,p_C) = \\frac{2m}{3p_C} $$ 1/3rd of income is spent on berries and 2/3rd of income is spent on chocolates. $$ p_B B^{*}(m,p_B) = \\frac{m}{3} \\\\ p_C C^{*}(m,p_C) = \\frac{2m}{3} $$ Notice the proportion is equal to the coefficients in the utility function $($i.e. $\\frac{1}{3}$ and $\\frac{2}{3}$$)$, which is a characteristic of Cobb-Douglas utility function. Answers:$$ B^{*}(m,p_B) = \\frac{300}{3 \\times 5} = 20 \\\\ C^{*}(m,p_C) = \\frac{2 \\times 300}{3 \\times 4 } = 50 $$ Question 4: Consider a general utility function $U(x_1, x_2)$. Let's now solve for the optimal bundle generally using the Lagrangian Method. 1. Write down the objective function and constraint in math. 2. Set up the Lagrangian Equation. 3. Fnd the first derivatives. 4. Find the first order conditions. What's the interpretation for $\\lambda$? 5. Rearrange them to get the tangency condition. Solutions $ max ${$ U(x_1, x_2) $}$ $ subject to $p_{x_1} x_1 + p_{x_2} x_2 = m$ $ L = U(x_1, x_2) + \\lambda (m - p_{x_1} x_1 - p_{x_2} x_2)$ $$ \\frac{\\partial U(x_1,x_2)}{\\partial x_1} - \\lambda p_{x_1} = MU_{x_1} - \\lambda p_{x_1} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial U(x_1,x_2)}{\\partial x_2} - \\lambda p_{x_2} = MU_{x_2} - \\lambda p_{x_2} $$ Set the above derivatives equal to zero. $$ MU_{x_1} (x_1 = x_1^{*}) - \\lambda p_{x_1} = 0 \\implies \\frac{MU_{x_1}(x_1 = x_1^{*})}{p_{x_1}} = \\lambda \\\\ MU_{x_2} (x_2 = x_2^{*}) - \\lambda p_{x_2} = 0 \\implies \\frac{MU_{x_2} (x_2 = x_2^{*})}{p_{x_2}} = \\lambda $$ $\\lambda$ measures the marginal utility of relaxing a constraint, which is an income. $$ \\frac{MU_{x_1}(x_1 = x_1^{*})}{MU_{x_2} (x_2 = x_2^{*})} = \\frac{p_{x_1}}{p_{x_2}} $$ Question 5: Jess has the utility function $U(x_1,x_2) = min ${$ 2x_1, x_2 $}$ $. The price of $x_1$ is $p_{x_1}$, the price of $x_2$ is $p_{x_2}$, and his income is $m$. 1. Find Jess\u2019s optimal bundle $x_1^{*}$ and $x_2^{*}$ as a function of $p_{x_1}$, $p_{x_2}$, and $m$. 2. What's the proportion of consumption amounts between $x_1^{*}$ and $x_2^{*}$? In other words, find $\\frac{x_1^{*}}{x_2^{*}}$. 3. Suppose instead the utility function is $U(x_1,x_2) = min ${$ \\frac{x_1}{2}, \\frac{x_2}{3} $}$ $. Without solving for the optimal bundles, what's the proportion of consumption amounts between $x_1^{*}$ and $x_2^{*}$, i.e. $\\frac{x_1^{*}}{x_2^{*}}$? Solutions With perfect complements utility function, the optimal bundle is at the kink point which is when the two inputs of minimum function are equal, i.e. $2x_1 = x_2$. Plug $2x_1 = x_2$ into the budget constraint $BC = x_1 p_{x_1} + x_2 p_{x_2} = m$: $$ \\begin{align} \\implies BC &= x_1 p_{x_1} + (2 x_1) p_{x_2} = x_1 ( p_{x_1} + 2p_{x_2}) = m \\\\ \\implies x_1^{*} &= \\frac{m}{p_{x_1} + 2p_{x_2}} \\\\ \\implies x_2^{*} &= 2 x_1^{*} = 2 \\frac{m}{p_{x_1} + 2p_{x_2}} \\\\ \\end{align} $$ $\\frac{x_1^{*}}{x_2^{*}} = \\frac{1}{2} $ $ \\frac{x_1^{*}}{2} = \\frac{x_2^{*}}{3} \\implies \\frac{x_1^{*}}{x_2^{*}} = \\frac{2}{3}$. Alternatively you can read off the numbers in the denominators of the utility function. Question 6: Logan has preferences over olives $(x_1)$ and ice creams $(x_2)$. He prefers to eat them separately but not together, which is represented by: $$ U(x_1, x_2) = x_1^2 + x_2^2.$$ Also suppose his income is ${$}$100 and the prices of olives and ice creames are $p_{x_1} = {$}1$ and $p_{x_2} = {$}2$, respectively. Is this convex preferences or concave preferences? Solve for the bundle that satisfis the tangency condition. What's the level of utility using the bundle you just solved in Q6.2? Consider spending all of your income on olives $(x_1)$. What's the utility from this bundle? Which bundle does Logan prefer between the bundle in Q6.2 and Q6.4? Does the tangency condition lead to the optimal bundle? What's the optimal bundle when price of olives is ${$}$3. Solutions The preference that prefers a bundle of single good over the average bundle is concave preferences. $ \\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = \\frac{p_{x_1}}{p_{x_2}} \\implies \\frac{2 x_1}{2 x_2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies x_2 = 2 x_1$. Plug this into the budget constraint $BC = 1 x_1 + 2 x_2 = 100$: $ BC = 1 x_1 + 2 (2 x_1) = 5 x_1 = 100 \\implies x_1 = 20 $ and $x_2 = 40$ 3. $20^2 + 40^2 = 2000$ 4. $100^2 + 0^2 = 10,000$ 5. Logan prefers the boundary bundle (100,0) over the interior bundle (20,40). With concave preferences, the tangency condition does not lead to the optimal bundle. 6. With higher price for olives, the optimal bundle is $(0, \\frac{m}{p_{x_2}}) = (0, \\frac{100}{2}) = (0,50).$ Question 7: Consider a utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = 2x_1 + x_2$. What is the optimal bundle with $p_{x_1}$, $p_{x_2}$, and income $m$? What is the optimal bundle with $p_{x_1} = 6$, $p_{x_2} = 3$, and income $30$? Solutions: Since perefect substitutes preferences allow for the corner solutions, we cannot use the tangency condition. There are two ways to tackle the corner solution problems. First, as shown in the lecture, we compare |MRS| with |price ratio|. |MRS| is equal to 2. Hence, as long as $\\frac{p_{x_1}}{p_{x_2}} < 2$, the optimal bundle will be $(\\frac{m}{p_{x_1}},0)$. If $\\frac{p_{x_1}}{p_{x_2}} > 2$, the optimal bundle will be $(0,\\frac{m}{p_{x_2}})$. If $\\frac{p_{x_1}}{p_{x_2}} = 2$, the optimal bundle is any $ (x_1^{*},x_2^{*}) $ such that $ p_{x_1} \\times x_1^{*} + p_{x_2} \\times x_2^{*} = m $. Second way to solve this problem is to compare $\\frac{MU_1}{p_{x_1}}$ with $\\frac{MU_2}{p_{x_2}}$, which is equivalent to the comparison of |MRS| with $\\frac{p_{x_1}}{p_{x_2}}$. For example, if $\\frac{MU_1}{p_{x_1}} > \\frac{MU_2}{p_{x_2}}$, you spend all of your income on good 1 because the marginal utility per dollar spent on good 1 is higher than the marginal utility per dollar spent on good 2. Since the price ratio of 2 is equal to |MRS|, It implies any bundle that satisfies $6 \\times x^{*}_1 + 3 \\times x^{*}_2 = 30$ is optimal. Question 8: Consider a utility function $u(x_1, x_2) = \\sqrt{x_1} + \\sqrt{x_2}$. 1. What is the optimal bundle with $p_{x_1}$, $p_{x_2}$, and income $m$? 2. $($optional$)$ Would the corner solution where all income is spent on single good be possible? Solutions: $MU_{x_1} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x_1}}$ and $MU_{x_2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x_2}}$. First, we solve for the optimal bundle using the tangency condition. $$ \\frac{MU_{x_1}}{MU_{x_2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x_2}}{\\sqrt{x_1}} = \\frac{p_{x_1}}{p_{x_2}} \\implies \\frac{x_2}{x_1} = \\Big(\\frac{p_{x_1}}{p_{x_2}}\\Big)^2 \\implies x_2^{*} = \\Big(\\frac{p_{x_1}}{p_{x_2}}\\Big)^2 x_1^{*} $$ Plug it into the BC. $$ p_{x_1} \\times x_1^{*}+ p_{x_2} \\times \\Big(\\frac{p_{x_1}}{p_{x_2}}\\Big)^2 x_1^{*} = m \\\\ \\implies p_{x_1} \\times x_1^{*}+ \\frac{p_{x_1}^2}{p_{x_2}} x_1^{*} = m \\\\ \\implies x_1^{*} \\Big(p_{x_1} + \\frac{p_{x_1}^2}{p_{x_2}}\\Big) = m \\\\ \\implies x_1^{*} = m/ \\Big(p_{x_1} + \\frac{p_{x_1}^2}{p_{x_2}}\\Big) = \\frac{p_{x_2} m}{p_{x_1}(p_{x_1} + p_{x_2})} \\\\ \\implies x_2^{*} = \\Big(\\frac{p_{x_1}}{p_{x_2}}\\Big)^2 x_1^{*} = \\frac{p_{x_1} m}{p_{x_2}(p_{x_1} + p_{x_2})} \\\\ $$ To make sure that the interior solution from the tangency condition is optimal, we can plug in the corner solutions into the utility function and see if the level of utility is higher than the level from the interior solution. In this case, the tangency condition leads to the optimal solution. By looking at the $MU_{x_1} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x_1}}$ and $MU_{x_2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{x_2}}$, we can see that a tiny positive amount of either $x_1$ or $x_2$ $($i.e. as $x_1$ and $x_2$ goes to zero in the limit $)$ gives the infinite level of utility, implying that posivie numbers of both goods are preferable than consuming only one good. Hence, the corner solution is not possible.","title":"Hw2 solutions"},{"location":"hw2_solutions/#homework-assignment-2","text":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A) Kristian L\u00f3pez Vargas UCSC - Spring 2017 Due on Friday 21 Apr 2017 Homework assignments will be turned-in on paper, at the beginning of the corresponding lecture.

What is the price elasticity of demand for breakfast sandwiches at the price of $0.5, 1, 2, 3,$ and $4$, respectively: As you can see, the price elasticity is different depending on the values of prices at which it is evaluated. For what price is the own price elasticity of demand one? In other words, for what price is demand unit elastic? For what range of prices is demand elastic $\\left(\\left|\\varepsilon_{Q^{d},P}\\right|>1\\right)$? For what range of prices is demand inelastic $\\left(\\left|\\varepsilon_{Q^{d},P}\\right|<1\\right)$? Solutions: $ \\varepsilon_{Q^{d},P}=\\frac{\\Delta Q^{d}}{\\Delta P}\\cdot\\frac{P}{Q^{d}}=-100\\cdot\\frac{P}{500-100P}=\\frac{-100P}{500-100P} $ Plug different levels of $P$'s into the formula in Q2.1. The answers are, in absolute value, $0.11, 0.25, 0.67, 1.5,$ and $4$, respectively. $$\\begin{align} 1&=\\frac{100P}{500-100P} \\\\ 500-100P&=100P \\\\ 200P&=500 \\\\ P&=2.5 \\end{align}$$ For the given demand function, demand becomes more elastic as the price rises. Therefore, demand is elastic for $P>2.50$. Conversely, for $0 \\leq P<2.50$, it is inelastic. Note that elasticity is zero for $P=0$. Question 3: Suppose we have a market with 100 individuals with preferences over two goods, $x$ and $y$. Consider that all 100 individuals have the utility function $U=x^{2/3}y^{1/3}$ and that each individual has the same income and is subject to the same prices. Calculate the market demand for $x$ as a function of income and prices. Find the own price elasticity of demand for good $x$. Is the elasticity constant or is it changing at different values of $P_x$? Suppose now that we know $m=90, P_{x}=2,$ and $P_{y}=1$. What is the market demand for $x$? This should be a number. Consider now that 50 individuals $($type A$)$ have the utility function $U=x^{2/3}y^{1/3}$ and the other 50 $($type B$)$have the utility function $U=x^{1/3}y^{2/3}$. Each individual still has the same income and is subject to the same prices. Calculate the market demand for $x$ as a function of income and prices. Suppose now that we know $m=90, P_{x}=2$, and $P_{y}=1$. What is the market demand for $x$? This should be a number. Solutions $x = \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}$ using the Cobb-Douglas demand formula also written in the Q1 above. This provides us with the individual demand. Since everyone is the same, market demand is just: $Q_{x}^{d}=\\sum_{i=1}^{100}x_{i}=100 \\times x=\\frac{200}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}$ $\\frac{\\partial Q^d_{x}}{\\partial P_x} \\frac{P_x}{Q^d_x} = -\\frac{200}{3} m (\\frac{1}{P^2_x}) \\Big(\\frac{P_x}{\\frac{200}{3} \\frac{m}{P_x}} \\Big) = -1$. Cobb-Douglas preferences features a constant elasticity of demand. More generally, any demand function that has a form of $Q = Ap^{\\varepsilon}$ has a constant elasticity of demand. We use the formula from above: $Q_{x}^{d}=\\frac{200}{3}\\times\\frac{90}{2}=3,000$ We already know type A individuals will have the individual demand: $x_{A}=\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}$. Type B individuals will have the individual demand: $x_B = \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}$. Market demand, therefore, is: $Q_{x}^{d}=\\sum_{i=1}^{100}x_{i}=50\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}\\right)+50\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}\\right)=\\left(100+50\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\frac{m}{P_{x}}\\right)=50\\frac{m}{P_{x}}$ Using the formula from above, $Q_{x}^{d}=50\\times\\frac{90}{2}=2,250$ Question 4: Consider the smoothie example given in class: Write down the production function of Tutti Frutti Smoothie example given in class. Make sure that all ingredients are expressed in Oz. Identify the returns to scale of this production function. Is it decreasing, increasing, or constant returns to scale? Solutions $Q=\\min\\{\\frac{mango}{3.75}\\,,\\frac{banana}{2.5}\\,,\\frac{strawberry}{3.75}\\,,\\frac{appleJuice}{10}\\} $ A common mistake is to give this function: $$ Q=\\min \\{3.75mango\\,,2.5banana\\,,3.75strawberry\\,,10AppleJuice \\}. $$ To see why this one is wrong plug in the exact amount of ingredients for one glass of smoothie $($3.75 of mango, 2.5 banana, etc$)$ and realize this function does not give you back 1 glass of smoothie! First, remember and undesrstand this mathematical fact: If you have $x < z$ and $ \\lambda>0 $, then $\\lambda x < \\lambda z $. That is, the order is preserved, always! $($try with some numbers$)$ Therefore, if $x$ and $z$ are inputs of a min production function $Q(x,z)=\\min\\{ax\\,,\\,bz\\}$, we have: $Q(\\lambda x,\\lambda z)=\\min\\{a\\,\\lambda x\\,,\\,b\\,\\lambda z\\}=\\lambda\\min\\{ax\\,,\\,bz\\}=\\lambda Q(x,z)$ The same logic applies if we have more inputs like in our case. Hence: $$ \\begin{align} &\\min\\{\\frac{{\\color{blue}\\lambda}mango}{3.75}\\,,\\frac{{\\color{blue}\\lambda}banana}{2.5}\\,,\\frac{{\\color{blue}\\lambda}strawberry}{3.75}\\,,\\frac{{\\color{blue}\\lambda}appleJuice}{10}\\} \\\\ &={\\color{blue}\\lambda}*\\min\\{\\frac{mango}{3.75}\\,,\\frac{banana}{2.5}\\,,\\frac{strawberry}{3.75}\\,,\\frac{appleJuice}{10}\\} \\end{align} $$ Therefore, we have constant returns to scale. In general, any production function of this form $\\min\\{ax\\,,\\,by\\,,\\,cz\\,,...,\\,dw\\}$ where $x, y, z,..., w$ are the inputs and $a, b, c ... d$ are fixed coefficients will yield constant retursn to scale. Question 5: Consider the following production function that depends only on labor:$Q=5L^{1/2}$ Write a combination of input and output that are technically efficient. In other words, for what level of $L$ and $Q$, is the technology efficient? Write a combination of input and output that are technically inefficient. In other words, for what level of $L$ and $Q$, is the technology inefficient? Write a combination of input and output that are technically unattainable. In other words, for what level of $L$ and $Q$, is the technology unattainable? Solutions Anything such that $Q=5L^{1/2}$. An example would be $\\left(L=4,Q=10\\right)$. Anything such that $Q<5L^{1/2}$. An example would be $\\left(L=4,Q=8\\right)$. Anything such that $Q>5L^{1/2}$. An example would be $\\left(L=4,Q=12\\right)$. Question 6: Consider the following production function that depends only on labor:$Q=L+10L^{2}-L^{3}$ Compute the $APL$ $($average product of labor$)$. Compute the $MPL$ $($marginal product of labor$)$. What is the value of $L^{*}$ at which $APL$ is the highest? For $L > L^{*}$, which one is bigger, $APL$ or $MPL$? How about when $L < L^{*}$ and $L = L^{*}$? Draw $APL$ and $MPL$ on the y-axis as a function of $L$ on the x-axis. Label the point of the intersection of $APL$ and $MPL$. Solutions $APL=\\frac{Q}{L}=1+10L-L^{2}$ $MPL=\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial L}=1+20L-3L^{2}$ $\\frac{\\partial APL}{\\partial L} = 10 - 2L$ By setting it equal to zero, we get $L^{*} = 5$. $MPL < APL$ for $L>5$. As the marginal product is lower than the average product, $APL$ decreases as $L$ increases. $MPL > APL$ for $L<5$. As the marginal product is higher than the average product, $APL$ increases as $L$ increases. $APL = MPL$ when $L=5$. See the graph below or here . Question 7: Consider the following production function: $Q=AL^{a}K^{b}$. Assume $A>0$. Further assume $0<a<1$, and $0<b<1$. What is the Marginal Product of Labor $(MP_{L})$? Is it diminishing as $L$ increases? What is the Marginal Product of Capital $(MP_{K})$? Is it diminishing as $K$ increases? What is the Average Product of Labor $(AP_{L})$? What is the Average Product of Capital $(AP_{K})$? What is the $TRS_{L,K}$ ? Is the absolute value of $TRS_{L,K}$ diminishing in $K$? Is it diminishing in $L$? Are there constant, decreasing, or increasing returns to scale? How does this depend on the parameters? Solutions $$ \\begin{align} MP_{L}& = \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial L}=AaL^{a-1}K^{b} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial MP_{L}}{\\partial L} &= Aa\\left(a-1\\right)L^{a-2}K^{b}<0 \\\\ MP_{K} &= \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial K}=AbL^{a}K^{b-1} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial MK_{L}}{\\partial K} &= Ab\\left(b-1\\right)L^{a}K^{b-2}<0 \\\\ \\end{align} $$ Since we know $0<a<1$ and $0<b<1$, we know that both marginal products are diminishing. This is because $a-1<0$ and $b-1<0$, and all other terms are positive. $AP_{L} = \\frac{Q}{L}=AL^{a-1}K^{b}$ and $AP_{K} = \\frac{Q}{K}=AL^{a}K^{b-1}$ $$ \\begin{align} MRTS_{L,K}&=\\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}} \\\\ &=\\frac{AaL^{a-1}K^{b}}{AbL^{a}K^{b-1}}=\\frac{a}{b}\\frac{K}{L}. \\end{align} $$ This diminishes as we increase $L$ and decrease $K$. $$ \\begin{align} Q \\left(TL,TK\\right) &= A\\left(TL\\right)^{a}\\left(TK\\right)^{b} \\\\ &= AT^{a}L^{a}T^{b}K^{b} \\\\ &= T^{a+b}AL^{a}K^{b} \\\\ &= T^{a+b}Q\\left(L,K\\right) \\end{align} $$ If $a+b=1$, the technology exhibits constant returns to scale. $If a+b<1$, the technology exhibits decreasing returns to scale. $If a+b>1$, the technology exhibits increasing returns to scale. Question 8: Consider the following production function: $Q=\\left(L+K\\right)^{1/2}$ What is the Marginal Product of Labor $(MP_{L})$? What is the Marginal Product of Capital $(MP_{K})$? Are they diminishing? What is the Average Product of Labor $(AP_{L})$? What is the Average Product of Capital $(MP_{K})$? What is the $TRS_{L,K}$ ? Is the absolute value of $TRS_{L,K}$ diminishing in $L$ or $K$? Are there constant, decreasing, or increasing returns to scale? Solutions $$ \\begin{align} MP_{L} = \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial L}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{\\left(L+K\\right)^{1/2}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial MP_{L}}{\\partial L} = -\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{\\left(L+K\\right)^{3/2}}<0 \\\\ MP_{K} = \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial K}=\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{\\left(L+K\\right)^{1/2}} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial MP_{K}}{\\partial K} = -\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{\\left(L+K\\right)^{3/2}}<0. \\end{align} $$ $MP_L$ is diminishing in $L$ and $MP_K$ is diminishing in $K$. $$\\begin{align} AP_{L} &= \\frac{Q}{L}=\\frac{\\left(L+K\\right)^{1/2}}{L} \\\\ AP_{K} &= \\frac{Q}{K}=\\frac{\\left(L+K\\right)^{1/2}}{K} \\end{align} $$ $$\\begin{align} MRTS_{L,K}=-\\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}}=-\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{\\left(L+K\\right)^{1/2}}}{\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{\\left(L+K\\right)^{1/2}}}=-1 \\end{align} $$ No, it is constant. $$\\begin{align} Q\\left(TL,TK\\right) &= \\left(TL+TK\\right)^{1/2} \\\\ &= \\left[T\\left(L+K\\right)\\right]^{1/2} \\\\ &= T^{1/2}\\left(L+K\\right)^{1/2} \\\\ &= T^{1/2}Q\\left(L,K\\right) \\end{align} $$ The technology exhibits decreasing returns to scale.","title":"Hw3 solutions"},{"location":"hw3_solutions/#homework-assignment-3","text":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A) Kristian L\u00f3pez Vargas UCSC - Spring 2017 Due on Friday 5 May 2017 Homework assignments will be turned-in on paper, at the beginning of the corresponding lecture.

What is the cost of producing $Q=16$ in the short run at these input prices? Solutions Begin with the optimal conditions from cost minimization: $$ \\begin{align} \\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}} & = \\frac{w}{r}\\\\ \\frac{2K^{1/2}L^{-1/2}}{2K^{-1/2}L^{1/2}} & = \\frac{w}{r}\\\\ \\frac{K}{L} & = \\frac{w}{r}\\\\ K & = \\frac{w}{r}\\cdot L\\end{align}$$ We pair this condition with the production function: $$\\begin{align} Q & = 4\\left(\\frac{w}{r}\\cdot L\\right)^{1/2}L^{1/2}\\\\ Q & = 4\\left(\\frac{w}{r}\\right)^{1/2}L\\\\ L^{*}(w,r,Q) & = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{r}{w}\\right)^{1/2}Q\\end{align}$$ Note that: $$\\begin{align} K^{*}(w,r,Q) & = \\frac{w}{r}\\cdot L^{*}(w,r,Q)\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{w}{r}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{r}{w}\\right)^{1/2}Q\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{w}{r}\\right)^{1/2}Q \\end{align} $$ We can simply insert these numbers into our formula from part (a): $$\\begin{align} L^{*}\\left(4,1,16\\right) & = \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{1/2}\\cdot16=2\\\\ K^{*}\\left(4,1,16\\right) & = \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{4}{1}\\right)^{1/2}\\cdot16=8\\end{align}$$ Knowing this, we can calculate the cost of producing $Q=16$ at these prices: $$\\begin{align} Cost^{*}(w,r,Q) & = wL^{*}(w,r,Q)+rK^{*}(w,r,Q)\\\\ & = 4\\cdot2+1\\cdot8=16\\end{align}$$ We now find the optimal choice of labor given $K=4$: $$Q\\left(L|K=4\\right)=4\\left(4\\right)^{1/2}L^{1/2}=8L^{1/2}$$ $$\\begin{align} 8L^{1/2} & = Q\\\\ L^{1/2} & = \\frac{Q}{8}\\\\ L & = \\frac{Q^{2}}{64}=\\frac{16^{2}}{8^{2}}=4\\end{align}$$ The cost is given by: $$\\begin{align} Cost_{SR}(w,r,Q) & = wL_{SR}(w,r,Q)+rK_{SR}\\\\ & = 4\\cdot4+1\\cdot4=20\\end{align}$$ Question 2: Suppose a firm has the following production function: $$ Q(L,K)=\\min \\{K,4L\\} $$ Recall that the isocost line is as follows: $$ C=wL+rK $$ What is the $($long-run$)$ optimal choice of $L$ and $K$ for a given $Q$, $w$, and $r$? In other words, provide a formula for the optimal choice of labor $L^{*}(w,r,Q)$ and capital $K^{*}(w,r,Q)$ as a function of the parameters $Q$, $w$, and $r$. Given $Q=16$, $w=4$, and $r=1$, what are the optimal levels of labor and capital, $L^{*}$ and $K^{*}$? What is the cost of producing $Q=16$ at these input prices? Suppose now that you are in the short run, $Q=16$, $w=4$, $r=1$, and the capital level is fixed at $\\bar{K}=20$. What is the optimal level of labor in the short run? What is the cost of producing $Q=16$ in the short run at these input prices? Would it be possible to meet $Q=16$ if $K=4$ in the short run? Solutions Recall that the optimal choice for a $($perfect complements$)$ production function lies along the ray $ aK=bL $ $($ in this case, $K=4L$ $)$ from the origin. With this in mind, $$K^{*}(w,r,Q)=4L^{*}(w,r,Q)=Q$$ In other words, the optimal long-run choice of labor and capital for a given quantity does not depend on factor prices. $$\\begin{align} K^{*}(w,r,Q) & = Q\\\\ L^{*}(w,r,Q) & = \\frac{1}{4}Q\\end{align}$$ We can simply insert these numbers into our formulas from part (a): $$\\begin{align} K^{*}\\left(4,1,16\\right) & = 16\\\\ L^{*}\\left(4,1,16\\right) & = \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot16=4\\end{align}$$ The cost of producing $Q=16$ is $C = rK + wL = 1\\times 16 + 4 \\times 4 = 32 $. Note that if $K=20$, the production function becomes: $$ Q(L)=\\min \\{ 20,4L\\}. $$ In other words, if $4L\\le20$ $($ i.e. $L\\le5$ $)$: $$Q(L)=4L.$$ For $L>5$, $$Q(L)=20$$ If $Q=16,$ the optimal choice of $L$ would be: $$\\begin{align} 4L_{SR} & = Q=16\\\\ L_{SR} & = 4\\end{align}$$ The short-run cost is $$C = r\\bar{K} + wL = 1\\times 20 + 4 \\times 4 = 36 $$ If $K=4$, note that $$ Q(L)=\\min\\{ 4,4L\\} $$ The maximum possible $Q$ would be 4, so $Q=16$ is not attainable. Question 3: Suppose a firm has the following production function: $$Q(L,K)=3L+K$$ Recall that the isocost line is as follows: $$C=wL+rK$$ What is the $($ long-run $)$ optimal choice of $L$ and $K$ for a given $Q$, $w$, and $r$? In other words, provide a formula for the optimal choice of labor $ L^{*}(w,r,Q) $ and capital $ K^{*}(w,r,Q)$ as a function of the parameters $Q$, $w$, and $r$. Given $Q=16$, $w=4$, and $r=1$, what are $L^{*}$ and $K^{*}$? Solutions Note that for perfect substitutes, the solution will be to produce using only one input unless $ \\frac{w}{r}=\\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}} $. We know that we will produce using only labor if: $$\\begin{align} \\frac{MP_{L}}{w} & > \\frac{MP_{K}}{r}\\\\ \\frac{3}{w} & > \\frac{1}{r}. \\end{align}$$ We also know that this would entail a production function of: $$Q=3L$$ Similarly, we will produce using only capital if: $$\\begin{align} \\frac{MP_{L}}{w} & < \\frac{MP_{K}}{r}\\\\ \\frac{3}{w} & < \\frac{1}{r}\\end{align}$$ Which would entail a production function of: $$Q=K$$ Therefore: $$ L^{*}(w,r,Q)=\\begin{cases} \\frac{Q}{3} & if\\ \\frac{w}{r}<3\\\\ \\in\\left[0,\\frac{Q}{3}\\right] & if\\ \\frac{w}{r}=3\\\\ 0 & if\\ \\frac{w}{r}>3 \\end{cases}$$ $$K^{*}(w,r,Q)=\\begin{cases} 0 & if\\ \\frac{w}{r}<3\\\\ Q-3L & if\\ \\frac{w}{r}=3\\\\ Q & if\\ \\frac{w}{r}>3 \\end{cases} $$ We can substitute these numbers into our formulas from the question above. Note that $\\frac{w}{r}=4>3$ $$\\begin{align} L^{*}\\left(4,1,16\\right) & = 0\\\\ K^{*}\\left(4,1,16\\right) & = Q=16\\end{align}$$ Question 4: A firm uses two inputs, capital and labor, to produce output. Its production function exhibits a diminishing technical rate of substitution $($e.g. Cobb-Douglas production function$)$. If the price of capital and the price of labor increase by the same percentage $($e.g., 40 percent$)$, what will happen to the cost-minimizing input quantities for a given output level? If the price of capital increases by 20 percent while the price of labor increases by 40 percent, what will happen to the cost-minimizing input quantities for a given output level? Solutions The cost-minimizing input quantities for a given output level will not change, as they depend only on the ratio of input prices $\\frac{w}{r}$. Since $\\frac{w}{r}$ is now higher than before the price change, the new choice of $L$ and $K$ would also have to satisfy a higher technical rate of substitution to ensure that $$\\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}}=\\frac{w}{r}.$$ This implies that, for a production function with a diminishing technical rate of substitution, the firm would be using less labor $($ graphically the slope of isoquant is steeper $)$. Question 5: Suppose a brewery uses a Cobb-Douglas production function for his production. He studies the production process and finds the following. An additional machine-hour of fermentation capacity would increase output by 400 bottles per day $(i.e. MP_K = 400)$. An additional man-hour of labor would increase output by 900 bottles per day $(i.e. MP_L = 900)$. The price of a man-hour of labor is ${$}$18 per hour. The price of a machine-hour of fermentation capacity is ${$}$5 per hour. Is the brewery currently minimizing its cost of production? Check using the minimization condition. It turns out, the brewery is not optimally chossing the factors of production. To lower its production cost, which factor of production should the brewery increase and which factor should he decrease? Suppose that the price of a machine-hour of fermentation capacity rises to ${$}$8 per hour. How does this change the answer from part 1? Solutions We want to verify whether the brewery is producing at the cost-minimizing choice, which must satisfy: $$\\begin{align} \\frac{MP_{L}}{MP_{K}} & = \\frac{w}{r}, \\text{ or }\\\\ \\frac{MP_{L}}{w} & = \\frac{MP_{K}}{r}\\\\ \\end{align}$$ Now, plug in the numbers to check the condition: $$\\begin{align} \\frac{900}{18} & < \\frac{400}{5}\\\\ 50 & < 80\\end{align}$$ Since the minimization condition does not hold, he could reduce the cost of production without impacting the output level. Since the marginal product of a dollar spent on capital $\\left(\\frac{MP_{K}}{r}\\right)$ exceeds the marginal product of a dollar spent on labor $\\left(\\frac{MP_{L}}{w}\\right)$, the brewery could lower its total production costs and keep output constant by reducing labor inputs and increasing capital inputs.

Question 1: An automobile repair shop charges the competitive market price of ${$}$16 per bike repaired. The firm's short-run total cost is given by $STC(Q)=Q^{3}/3$. What quantity should the firm produce if it wants to maximize its profit? What is the maximized profit at the optimal level of quantity and the price of ${$}$16 $($ round to two decimal points $)$?

Suppose now the new price is $P'$. What is the profit-maximizing quantity as a function of $P'$. If the price increases by a factor of four $($i.e. price = 4P'$)$, how much does the profit-maximizing quantity increase? Solutions $$\\begin{aligned} P & = SMC\\\\\\ 16 & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Q}\\left(STC\\left(Q\\right)\\right)=Q^{2}\\\\\\ 4 & = Q\\end{aligned}$$ Profit $ = P \\cdot Q - \\frac{Q^3}{3} = 16 \\cdot 4 - \\frac{4^3}{3} = 42.67 $ See figure. Green is total revenue, blue is total cost, and red is profit. The profit-maximizing $Q$ is 4, and the profit at that point is 42.67. $$ \\begin{aligned} P' = SMC\\\\ P' = Q^2\\\\ Q = \\sqrt{P'} \\end{aligned}$$ If the price increases by a factor of four, then $Q_{new} = \\sqrt{4P'} = 2\\sqrt{P'} = 2Q$. The profit-maximizing quantity would increase by a factor of 2 when the price increases by a factor of 4. Question 2: Consider a firm that operates in the perfectly competitive salmon farming industry. The short-run total cost curve is $TC\\left(Q\\right)=400+2Q+0.5Q^{2}$ , where $Q$ is the number of salmon harvested per month. What is the equation for the average variable cost (AVC)? Solve for the firm's operation condition, $MC \\geq AVC$. Assuming $MC \\geq AVC$, what is the firm's short-run supply curve? Find the supply function, NOT the inverse supply function. In light of the answer in part 2, What is the minimum price at which the firm operates? Solutions $$AVC=\\frac{TVC}{Q}=\\frac{2Q+0.5Q^{2}}{Q}=2+\\frac{1}{2}Q$$ The firm operates when $MC \\geq AVC$. $$ \\begin{aligned} MC & \\geq AVC\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Q}\\left(400+2Q+0.5Q^{2}\\right) & \\geq 2+\\frac{1}{2}Q\\\\ 2+Q & \\geq 2+\\frac{1}{2}Q\\\\ Q & \\geq 0\\end{aligned}$$ The short-run supply curve is found by setting price equal to short-run marginal cost: $P = 2 + Q$. $Q^S = P - 2 $ Using the operation condition $Q \\geq 0$, it implies that $P \\geq 2$ for the firm to operate in the market. If $P<2$, $Q^S=0$ Question 3: A competitive industry consists of identical 30 producers, all of whom operate with the identical short-run total cost curve $TC(Q)=40+Q^{2}$, where $Q$ is the annual output of a firm. The market demand curve is $Q^D=160-P$, where $P$ is the market price. What is the each firm's short-run supply curve? What is the short-run industry supply curve? Determine the short-run equilibrium price and quantity in this industry. Solutions In a competitive market, firms set the price equal to MC, which is $P = 2Q$. The firm operates only if $MC \\geq AVC$. $$\\begin{aligned} MC & \\geq AVC\\\\ 2Q & \\geq Q\\\\ Q & \\geq 0 \\end{aligned}$$ Therefore, for all $P \\geq 0 $, the short-run supply curve for each firm $i$ is $ Q_i^{S} = \\frac{1}{2}P$ for $i=1,...,30$. The market supply curve is given by aggregating the 30 producers linearly: $$\\begin{aligned} Q^S_{industry} & = \\sum_{i=1}^{30}Q^S_{i}\\\\ & = 30\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}P\\right)\\\\ & = 15P\\end{aligned}$$ We can find the short-run equilibrium price and quantity by setting supply and demand equal to each other: $$\\begin{aligned} Q^S_{industry} & = Q^D \\\\ 15P & = 160-P\\\\ 16P & = 160\\\\ P^{*} & = 10\\end{aligned}$$ $$Q^{*}=15P^{*}=15\\cdot10=150$$ Question 4: The ethanol industry is perfectly competitive, and each producer has the long-run marginal cost function $MC(Q)=48-24Q+3Q^{2}$. The corresponding long-run average cost function is $AC(Q)=48-12Q+Q^{2}$. The market demand curve for ethanol is $Q^D=240-10P$. What is one firm's inverse long-run supply curve with the minimum level of price for the firm to operate? What is the optimal level of quantity produced by each firm in the long-run? What is the long-run equilibrium price in this industry? What is the long-run industry $($or market$)$ supply curve? What is ther equilibrium quantity demanded in this market? How many active producers are in the ethanol market in a long-run competitive equilibrium? Solutions By setting the price equal to MC, we get $P = 48 - 24Q + 3Q^2$. The firm operates only if $MC \\geq AC$. $$ \\begin{aligned} MC & \\geq AC \\\\ 48 - 24Q + 3Q^2 & \\geq 48-12Q+Q^2 \\\\ -12Q + 2 Q^2 & \\geq 0 \\\\ Q^2 - 6Q & \\geq 0 \\\\ Q(Q - 6) & \\geq 0 \\\\ Q & \\geq 6 \\text{ or } P = 48 - 24 \\cdot 6 + 3 \\cdot 6^2 \\geq 12 \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ Therefore, for all $P \\geq 12 $, the long-run supply curve for each firm $i$ is $ P^{S} = 48 - 24Q + 3Q^2 $ for $i=1,,,n$. In the long-run with a competitive market, each firm must satisfy the condition $AC = MC$ because the firms must make zero profits. Firms cannot make positive profits due to entry of competitors. Firms cannot make negative profits because there is no fixed cost and they can exit. Hence, $Q = 6$ from part 1. Using the firm's supply curve, $P^{S}(6) = 48-24\\cdot6+3\\cdot6^{2}=12$ In the long-run with a competitive market, the industry supply curve is flat at a price that minimizes the average cost (i.e. AC = MC). Hence, $P^{S}_{industry} = 12$. The equilibrium quantity is determined by the market demand given the equilibrium price of 12. Hence, $Q^D(12)=240-10(12) = 120$. Since each firm produces 6 units. There are 20 active producers $(= 120/6)$. Question 5: The avocado growing industry in Chile is perfectly competitive, and each producer has a long-run marginal cost curve given by $MC\\left(Q\\right)=30+4Q$. The corresponding long-run average cost function is given by $AC\\left(Q\\right)=30+2Q+\\frac{50}{Q}$. The market demand curve is $Q^D=400-2P$. What is the long-run quantity produced by each firm? What is the long-run equilibrium price in this industry? How many active producers are in the avocado growing industry in the long-run competitive market? Solutions 1.$$\\begin{aligned} AC & = MC\\\\ 30+2Q+\\frac{50}{Q} & = 30+4Q\\\\ \\frac{50}{Q} & = 2Q\\\\ 25 & = Q^{2}\\\\ 5 & = Q_{i}\\end{aligned}$$ $P=MC\\left(5\\right)=30+4\\cdot5=50$ The equilibrium quantity is determined by the market demand given the equilibrium price of 50. Hence, $Q^D(50)=400-2(50) = 300$. Since each firm produces 5 units. There are 60 active producers $(= 300/5)$. Question 6: Suppose that the market for cigarettes in a particular town has the following supply and demand curves: $Q^{S}=P$; $Q^{D}=60-P$. What is the equilibrium quantity and price? Suppose that the town council wants to reduce cigarette consumption. It imposes a quantity tax per unit of cigarettes on the consumer side. Find the new equilibrium quantity, the equilibrium price paid by the consumer, and the equilibrium price received by the producer. Suppose the flat tax is 20. What is the new equilibrium quantity, the price paid by consumer, and the price received by the supplier? Compute the consumer surplus before and after tax. Draw the supply and demand curve and label the equilibrium quantity and prices. Also shade the area of the consumer surplus before and after tax. If the council wants to reduce cigarette sales to 5, what would the appropriate tax be? Solutions $Q^S = Q^D$ implies that $P = 60 - P$, which gives the equlibrium price and quantity of 30. When the borrer pays the tax, we have: $P_D - T = P_S $. Plug this into the following condition: $Q^S(P_S) = Q^D(P_D)$. Then, we have: $$\\begin{align} Q^S(P_S) &= Q^D(P_S + T) \\\\ P_S &= 60 - (P_S+T) \\\\ 2P_S & = 60 - T \\\\ P^{*}_S &= 30 - \\frac{T}{2} \\\\ \\end{align}$$ Also $$P^{*}_D = P^{*}_S + T = \\Big(30 - \\frac{T}{2} \\Big) + T = 30 + \\frac{T}{2}. $$ Finally $$Q^{*} = Q^S(P^{*}_S) = P^{*}_S = 30 - \\frac{T}{2}.$$ We get the same result using $$Q^{*} = Q^D(P^{*}_D) = 60 - P^{*}_D = 30 - \\frac{T}{2}.$$ Let's plug in $T=20$ into the solutions we've found in part 2. $$\\begin{aligned} P^{*}_S & = 30-\\frac{20}{2}=20 \\\\ P^{*}_D & = 30+\\frac{20}{2}=40 \\\\ Q^{*} & = 30 - \\frac{20}{2} = 20 \\end{aligned}$$ $CS_{before} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 30 \\cdot 30 = 450$ and $CS_{after} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 20 \\cdot 20 = 200$. Here, we seek a value of $T$ such that $Q^{*}=5$. Recall that $Q^{*}=30-\\frac{T}{2}$ Therefore, $$\\begin{aligned} 5 & = 30-\\frac{T}{2}\\\\ \\frac{T}{2} & = 25\\\\ T & = 50\\end{aligned}$$ The appropriate tax would be ${$}$50.","title":"Hw5 solutions"},{"location":"hw5_solutions/#homework-assignment-5","text":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A) Kristian L\u00f3pez Vargas UCSC - Spring 2017 Due on Friday 19 May 2017 Homework assignments will be turned-in on paper, at the beginning of the corresponding lecture.

Late assignments will not be accepted. Only four randomly-chosen questions will be graded. It is graded out of 100 points and 5 points will be subtracted if you do not staple your homework. Question 1: Suppose that the monopolist faces a linear demand curve, $P(Q) = A - BQ$. Further suppose that the monopolist has the marginal cost function: $MC = Q$. Find the revenue as a function of Q. Find the marginal revenue as a function of Q. Find the quantity that maximizes the monopolist's profit as a function of A and B. Find the equilibrium price as a function of A and B. Let's use some numbers. Suppose $A=10$ and $B=2$. Solve for the profit-maximizing quantity and price. Using $A=10$ and $B=2$, draw a demand curve and a marginal revenue function as well as marginal cost $($i.e. supply curve$)$. Shade the deadweight loss. Also label clearly tha profit-maximizing quantity and price chosen by the monopolist. What would have been the competitive equilibrium price and quantity $($hint: equate MC and the demand function$)$? Label the competitive equilbrium point. Also compute the size of the deadweight loss due to inefficiency casued by the monopolist behavior. Solutions $R(Q) = P(Q)\\cdot Q = (A - B \\cdot Q)\\cdot Q = AQ - BQ^2$ $MR(Q) = A - 2BQ$ Setting $MR = MC$ gives $A-2BQ = Q$. By solving for $Q$, we get $Q_M = \\frac{A}{1+2B}$. Plug $Q_M$ into the demand curve. $$\\begin{aligned} P_M &= A - B \\cdot Q_M \\\\ P_M &= A - B \\cdot \\frac{A}{1+2B} = A - \\frac{AB}{1+2B} = \\frac{A+AB}{1+2B}\\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ $Q_M = \\frac{10}{1+2\\cdot 2} = 2$ and $P_M =\\frac{10+10\\cdot 2}{1+2\\cdot 2} = 6$. Green is marginal cost $($supply curve$)$, red is linear demand, and blue is marginal revenue function. The equilibrium quantity and price is $(2,6)$. The competitive equilibrium price can be found by $Q = 10-2Q$, which gives $Q = P = 10/3$. The deadweight loss is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4\\cdot (\\frac{10}{3} - 2)= \\frac{8}{3}$. Question 2: Suppose a monopolist faces a market demand of $Q^D=400-P$ and has a total cost function of $TC\\left(Q\\right)=Q^{2}$. What is the equilibrium price and quantity decided by the monopolist? What is the average cost at the equilibrium quantity? How much profit does the monopolist make at the equilibrium price and quantity? Solutions Recall that the monopolist chooses a price on the basis of $MR=MC$. Note that we need the demand function re-written to get $P$ as a function of $Q$. $$\\begin{aligned} Q & = 400-P\\\\ P & = 400-Q\\end{aligned}$$ In order to find $MR$: $$\\begin{aligned} MR & = \\frac{\\partial\\left(PQ\\right)}{\\partial Q}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Q}\\cdot\\left[\\left(400-Q\\right)Q\\right]=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Q}\\cdot\\left[400Q-Q^{2}\\right]\\\\ & = 400-2Q\\end{aligned}$$ We can find $MC$ by taking the derivative of total cost: $$MC=\\frac{\\partial TC}{\\partial Q}=2Q$$ Setting $MR$ and $MC$ equal: $$\\begin{aligned} 400-2Q & = 2Q\\\\ 400 & = 4Q\\\\ Q_{M} & = 100\\end{aligned}$$ To find the price, recall that: $$\\begin{aligned} P_{M} & = 400-Q_{M}\\\\ & = 400-100\\\\ & = 300\\end{aligned}$$ $AC = \\frac{TC}{Q} = \\frac{Q^2}{Q} = Q = 100$. For each unit, the monopolist makes a profit of 200 $(=P - AC = 300 - 100)$. Hence, the total profit is $200 \\cdot Q_M = 200 \\cdot 100 = 20,000$. Question 3: A homogeneous products duopoly faces a market demand function given by $Q=40-4P$, where $Q=Q_{1}+Q_{2}$. Both firms have a constant marginal cost $MC=2$. Suppose the two firms set their quantities simultaneously by guessing the other firm's quantity choice. Derive the equation of each firm's reaction curve and then graph these curves. What is the Cournot equilibrium quantity and price in this market for each firm? What would the equilibrium price in this market be if it were perfectly competitive? What is the Bertrand equilibrium price in this market? Solutions: First note that: $$P=10-\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot Q$$ In equilibrium, this means that: $$P=10-\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\left[Q_{1}+Q_{2}\\right]$$ Solving firm 1's maximization problem yields: $$\\max_{Q_{1}}P\\left(Q\\right)\\cdot Q_{1}-c\\left(Q_{1}\\right)$$ $$\\max_{Q_{1}} \\Big(10-\\frac{1}{4}Q_{1}-\\frac{1}{4}Q_{2} \\Big) Q_{1}-c (Q_{1})$$ Finding the first order condition: $$\\begin{aligned} 10-\\frac{1}{2}Q_{1}-\\frac{1}{4}Q_{2}-2 & = 0\\\\ \\frac{1}{2}Q_{1} & = 8-\\frac{1}{4}Q_{2}\\\\ Q_{1}\\left(Q_{2}\\right) & = 16-\\frac{1}{2}Q_{2} \\text{, or for graphing purpose } Q_2 = 32 - 2 Q_1\\end{aligned}$$ Because of the symmetery, the firm 2's reaction function is $$Q_{2}\\left(Q_{1}\\right)=16-\\frac{1}{2}Q_{1}$$ To find this, plug firm 2\u2019s reaction function into firm 1\u2019s reaction function: $$\\begin{aligned} Q_{1}\\left(Q_{2}\\left(Q_{1}\\right)\\right) & = 16-\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\left[16-\\frac{1}{2}Q_{1}\\right]\\\\ Q_{1}^{C} & = 16-8+\\frac{1}{4}Q_{1}^{C}\\\\ \\frac{3}{4}Q_{1}^{C} & = 8\\\\ Q_{1}^{C} & = \\frac{32}{3}=10.67\\end{aligned}$$ By symmetry, $$Q_{2}^{C}=10.67$$ The price is a function of quantities: $$\\begin{aligned} P^{C} & = 10-\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\left[Q_{1}^{C}+Q_{2}^{C}\\right]\\\\ & = 10-\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\left[10.67+10.67\\right]\\approx4.67\\end{aligned}$$ $P^{*}=MC=2$. The competitive equilibrium price is lower than Cournot equillibrium price. When there are two or more firms in a market, the Bertrand equilibrium price is set at the marginal cost. In this case, the two firms' marginal cost is equal, hence, $$P^{B}\\left(J>1\\right)=MC=2$$ Question 4: Consider a duopoly with each firm having different marginal costs. Each firm has a marginal cost curve $MC_{i}=20+Q_{i}$ for firm $i=1,2$. The market demand curve is $P=32-Q$, where $Q=Q_{1}+Q_{2}$. What are the Cournot equilibrium quantities and price in this market? What would be the equilibrium price in this market if the two firms acted as a profit-maximizing cartel $($i.e., attempt to set prices and outputs together to maximize total industry profits $)$? What would be the equilibrium price in this market if firms acted as price-taking firms $($there are still only two firms$)$? What is the Bertrand equilibrium price in this market? Solutions: $$\\max_{Q_{1}}\\left(32-Q_{1}-Q_{2}\\right)Q_{1}-c_{1}\\left(Q_{1}\\right)$$ $$\\begin{aligned} 32-2Q_{1}-Q_{2}-20-Q_{1} & = 0\\\\ 3Q_{1} & = 12-Q_{2}\\\\ Q_{1}\\left(Q_{2}\\right) & = 4-\\frac{1}{3}Q_{2}\\end{aligned}$$ By symmetry, $$Q_{2}\\left(Q_{1}\\right)=4-\\frac{1}{3}Q_{1}$$ Therefore, $$\\begin{aligned} Q_{1}\\left(Q_{2}\\left(Q_{1}\\right)\\right) & = 4-\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\left[4-\\frac{1}{3}Q_{1}\\right]\\\\ Q_{1}^{C} & = 4-\\frac{4}{3}+\\frac{1}{9}Q_{1}^{C}\\\\ \\frac{8}{9}Q_{1}^{C} & = \\frac{8}{3}\\\\ Q_{1}^{C} & = 3\\end{aligned}$$ By symmetry, $$Q_{2}^{C}=3$$ The price is a function of quantities: $$\\begin{aligned} P^{C} & = 32-Q_{1}^{C}-Q_{2}^{C}\\\\ & = 32-3-3=26\\end{aligned}$$ We will examine this from the perspective of each firm\u2019s profit-maximizing contribution: $$\\max_{Q_{1},Q_{2}}\\left(32-Q_{1}-Q_{2}\\right)\\left(Q_{1}+Q_{2}\\right)-c\\left(Q_{1}\\right)-c\\left(Q_{2}\\right)$$ $$\\max_{Q_{1},Q_{2}}\\left(32-Q_{1}-Q_{2}\\right)Q_{1}+\\left(32-Q_{1}-Q_{2}\\right)Q_{2}-c\\left(Q_{1}\\right)-c\\left(Q_{2}\\right)$$ $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Q_{1}} & = 32-2Q_{1}-Q_{2}-Q_{2}-20-Q_{1}=0\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial Q_{2}} & = 32-2Q_{2}-Q_{1}-Q_{1}-20-Q_{2}=0\\end{aligned}$$ Thus, the profit-maximizing $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{2}$ are given by: $$\\begin{aligned} 3Q_{1} & = 12-2Q_{2}\\\\ 3Q_{2} & = 12-2Q_{1}\\end{aligned}$$ Solving: $$\\begin{aligned} Q_{1} & = 4-\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\left(4-\\frac{2}{3}Q_{1}\\right)\\\\ Q_{1} & = \\frac{4}{3}+\\frac{4}{9}Q_{1}\\\\ \\frac{5}{9}Q_{1}^{cartel} & = \\frac{4}{3}\\\\ Q_{1}^{cartel} & = \\frac{12}{5}=2.4\\end{aligned}$$ Similarly, we can show that: $$Q_{2}^{cartel}=2.4$$ Price is a function of these quantities, so: $$P^{cartel}=32-2.4-2.4=27.2$$ We will examine from the perspective of firm 1: $$P^{*}=MC=20+Q_{1}$$ Therefore, individual supply $($from firm 1 and, by symmetry, from firm 2$)$ is: $$S_{i}\\left(P\\right)=P-20$$ And market supply is: $$S_{market}\\left(P\\right)=2\\cdot\\left(P-20\\right)=2P-40$$ Setting this equal to demand: $$\\begin{aligned} S\\left(P\\right) & = D\\left(P\\right)\\\\ 2P-40 & = 32-P\\\\ 3P & = 72\\\\ P^{*} & = 24\\end{aligned}$$ The Bertrand equilibrium price is set to the marginal cost. In this case, the two firms' marginal cost is Firms would undercut to the competitive equilibrium. $$P^{B}\\left(J>1\\right)=MC=P^{*}=24$$ Question 5: Consider an oligopoly in which firms choose quantities. The inverse market demand curve is given by $P=a-b\\left(q_{1}+q_{2}\\right)$, where $q_{1}$ is the quantity produced by Firm 1, and $q_{2}$ is the quantity produced by Firm 2. Each firm has a marginal cost equal to $c$. What is the equilibrium market quantity if the two firms acted as a cartel $($i.e., attempt to set prices and outputs together to maximize total industry profits$)$. How about the equilibrium market price? Instead of cartel, suppose now firm 1 acts as the leader and firm 2 acts as the follower. What is the Stackelberg equilibrium quantities determined by each firm? What is the equilibrium market price? Find $\\frac{\\pi_1}{\\pi_2}$ using the Stackelberg quantities and price. Whose profit is higher? Solutions: 1. The cartel's objective is to maximize the joint profits by choosing $q_1$ and $q_2$: $$\\max_{q_{1}, q_2}\\left[a-b\\left(q_{1}+q_{2}\\right)\\right]\\cdot (q_1 + q_2) -cq_{1} - cq_2$$ $$q_1: a - 2bq_1 - 2bq_2 = c \\\\ q_2: a-2bq_1- 2bq_2 = c$$ $$ \\implies Q_{cartel}^{*} = q_1 + q_2 = \\frac{a-c}{2b} $$ The equilibrium price can be found by pluging $Q^{*}$ into the demand function: $$P_{cartel}^{*} = a-b(q_1+q_2) = a-b\\frac{a-c}{2b} = \\frac{b(a + c)}{2b}.$$ 2. Consider firm 2 responding to firm 1\u2019s price, which it actually sees $$\\max_{q_{2}}P\\left(q_{1}+q_{2}\\right)q_{2}-cq_{2} = (a - b(q_1 +q_2))q_2 - cq_2$$ FOC with respect to $q_2$ gives $$a - bq_1 - bq_2 - bq_2 -c = 0 \\\\ \\implies q_{2}\\left(q_{1}\\right)=\\frac{a-c}{2b}-\\frac{1}{2}q_{1}$$ Now, firm 1 acts first, knowing that this is how firm 2 will respond: $$\\max_{q_{1}}P\\left(q_{1}+q_{2}\\left(q_{1}\\right)\\right)q_{1}-cq_{1}$$ $$\\max_{q_{1}}P\\left(q_{1}+\\frac{a-c}{2b}-\\frac{1}{2}q_{1}\\right)q_{1}-cq_{1}$$ In other words: $$\\max_{q_{1}}\\left[a-b\\left(q_{1}+\\frac{a-c}{2b}-\\frac{1}{2}q_{1}\\right)\\right]\\cdot q_{1}-cq_{1}$$ $$\\max_{q_{1}}aq_{1}-\\frac{b}{2}q_{1}^{2}-\\frac{a-c}{2}q_{1}-cq_{1}$$ $$\\max_{q_{1}}\\left(a-c-\\frac{a-c}{2}\\right)q_{1}-\\frac{b}{2}q_{1}^{2}$$ $$\\max_{q_{1}}\\left(\\frac{a-c}{2}\\right)q_{1}-\\frac{b}{2}q_{1}^{2}$$ The optimal choice of $q_{1}$ becomes: $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{a-c}{2}-bq_{1} & = 0\\\\ q_{1}^{S} & = \\frac{a-c}{2b}\\end{aligned}$$ Firm 2\u2019s choice in reaction is given by: $$\\begin{aligned} q_{2}\\left(\\frac{a-c}{2b}\\right) & = \\frac{a-c}{2b}-\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{a-c}{2b}\\right)\\\\ & = \\frac{2\\left(a-c\\right)-\\left(a-c\\right)}{4b}\\\\ q_{2}^{S} & = \\frac{a-c}{4b}\\end{aligned}$$ The price is a function of these quantities: $$\\begin{aligned} P^{S} & = a-b\\left(q_{1}^{S}+q_{2}^{S}\\right)\\\\ & = a-b\\left(\\frac{a-c}{2b}+\\frac{a-c}{4b}\\right)\\\\ & = a-\\left(\\frac{2\\left(a-c\\right)+a-c}{4}\\right)\\\\ & = a-\\frac{3(a-c)}{4}\\\\ & = \\frac{a+3c}{4}\\end{aligned}$$ 3. $$\\begin{aligned} \\pi_{1}\\left(q_{1}^{S},P^{S}\\right) & = \\left(P^{S}-c\\right)q_{1}^{S}\\\\ \\pi_{2}\\left(q_{2}^{S},P^{S}\\right) & = \\left(P^{S}-c\\right)q_{2}^{S}\\\\ \\implies \\frac{\\pi_1}{\\pi_2} &= \\frac{\\left(P^{S}-c\\right)q_{1}^{S}}{\\left(P^{S}-c\\right)q_{2}^{S}} = \\frac{\\frac{a-c}{2b}}{\\frac{a-c}{4b}} = 2 \\end{aligned}$$ The leader earns twice as much profit as the follower. Question 6: Suppose two firms, Genera Pharma and Futura Pharma, are the only two producers of a specific drug. Genera and Futura have the same formula and sell the drug for the same price, but they are considering whether or not to spend money on an advertising campaign. Each firm can either buy the advertising campaign or not buy it and the following table shows profits for four different scenarios. Genera AD No AD Futura AD (4,4) (9,0) No AD (0,9) (5,5) What is the scenario that maximizes the sum of profits of the two companies? Is there a dominant strategy for each firm? What is the pure strategy Nash Equilibrium? Denote the probability of choosing $AD$ for Futura as $f$ and for Genera as $g$. Find the best response function for Futura, $b_f(g)$, and Genera, $b_g(f)$. Solutions: The best collective outcome is when neither firm buys advertising $($ ${$}$10 million combined payout > ${$}$9m > ${$}$8m $)$ Advertising is the dominant strategy for both firms. The pure strategy Nash equilibrium is for both firms to advertise. Then Futura's payoff is: $$\\begin{align} &= 4fg + 9f(1-g) + 0(1-f)g + 5(1-f)(1-g) \\\\ &= 4fg + 9f - 9fg + 5 - 5f - 5g + 5fg \\\\ &= 4f + 5 - 5g\\\\ \\end{align}$$ It is maximized when $f^{*}=1$ regardless of the choise of the opponent. Hence, $b_f(g) = 1$. Genera's payoff is: $$\\begin{align} &= 4fg + 0f(1-g) + 9(1-f)g + 5(1-f)(1-g) \\\\ &= 4fg + 9g - 9fg + 5 - 5f - 5g + 5fg \\\\ &= 4g + 5 - 5f \\\\ \\end{align}$$ It is maximized when $g^{*}=1$ regardless of the choise of the opponent. Hence, $b_g(f) = 1$ Question 7: Below table shows the probability of winning for Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for each of two groundstrokes in tennis: down the line (DL) and crosscourt (CC). Roger Federer DL CC Rafael Nadal DL (50,50) (80,20) CC (90,10) (20,80) Find the pure strategy NE if any. Find the mixed strategy NE if any. Find the probability of winning of Federer and Nadal, respectively. Solutions: There's no pure strategy NE. Nadal solves for the value of p that equates Federer\u2019s payoff from positioning himself for DL or CC: $$\\begin{align} 50p+10(1\u2010p) &= 20p+80(1\u2010p) \\\\ 50p+10\u201010p &= 20p+80\u201080p \\\\ 40p+10 &= 80\u201060p \\\\ 100p &= 70 \\\\ p &= 70/100 = .70. \\end{align}$$ Federer solves for the value of q that equates Nadal's payoff from positioning herself for DL or CC: $$\\begin{align} 50q+80(1\u2010q) &= 90q+20(1\u2010q) \\\\ 50q+80\u201080q &= 90q+20\u201020q \\\\ 80\u201030q &= 70q+20 \\\\ 60 &= 100q \\\\ q &= 60/100 = .60. \\end{align}$$ Federer's probability of winning from DL is $DL=50(.70)+10(.30)=38\\%$ and the probability of winning from CC is $CC=20(.70)+80(.30)=38\\%$. Since the probabilities sum to 1, Nadal's probability of winning is 62%. Question 8: Coordination Game Consider the South Korea - North Korea arms race in which each country could build nuclear missiles or refrain from building them. The payoffs are shown in table below. North Korea Build Refrain South Korea Build (4,5) (4,1) Refrain (3,8) (10,10) What are the dominant strategies for each country if any? What are the pure strategy NE? Denote $n$ as the probability NK will build nuclear missles and $s$ as the probability SK will build nuclear missles. Find the best response function for each country, $b_s(n)$ and $b_n(s)$. Find the mixed strategy NE in light of the answer in part 2 Solutions: There is no dominant strategy for either country. $(Build, Build)$ and $(Refrain, Refrain)$ are the pure strategy equilibria. SK's payoff: $$ \\begin{align} &= 4sn + 3(1-s)n+4(1-n)s+10(1-s)(1-n)\\\\ &= 4sn + 3n - 3sn + 4s - 4sn + 10 - 10n - 10s + 10sn\\\\ &= 7sn - 6s + 10 - 7n \\\\ &= s(7n-6) + 10 - 7n \\end{align} $$ Hence SK's best response is, $$ b_s(n) =\\begin{cases} 0 & if\\ n < \\frac{6}{7} \\\\ \\in\\left[0,1\\right] & if\\ n = \\frac{6}{7} \\\\ 1& if\\ n > \\frac{6}{7} \\\\ \\end{cases} $$ NK's payoff: $$ \\begin{align} &= 5sn + 8(1-s)n+1(1-n)s+10(1-s)(1-n)\\\\ &= 5sn + 8n - 8sn + s - sn + 10 - 10n - 10s + 10sn\\\\ &= 6sn - 9s - 2n + 10\\\\ &= n(6s-2) + 10 - 9s \\end{align} $$ Hence NK's best response is, $$ b_n(s) =\\begin{cases} 0 & if\\ s < \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ \\in\\left[0,1\\right] & if\\ s = \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ 1& if\\ s > \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ \\end{cases} $$ $(s=\\frac{1}{3}, n=\\frac{6}{7})$ is the mixed strategy equilibrium. Question 9: Centipede game The centipede game, first introduced by Robert Rosenthal in 1981, is an extensive form game in which two players take turns choosing either to take a slightly larger share of an increasing pot, or to pass the pot to the other player. In other words, player 1 chooses between D $($Down$)$ and R $($Right$)$, where D is pocketing the pot and R is passing the pot to the player 2. Similarly, player 2 chooses between $d$ and $r$. The payoffs are arranged so that if one passes the pot to one's opponent and the opponent takes the pot on the next round, one receives slightly less than if one had taken the pot on this round. Find the subgame perfect Nash Equilibrium using backward induction. Solutions: For backward induction, we start from the last node at which player 2 decides between $d$ which gives $(2,4)$ and $r$ which gives $(3,3)$. Since $4>3$, the player 2 will choose $d$. Now on the second node from the last, knowing player 2 will choose $d$, player 1 chooses between $(3,1)$ and $(2,4)$. Since $3>2$, player 1 chooses $D$. Similarly, on the third node from the last, player 2 chooses $d$, and finally on the very first node, player 1 chooses $D$. To write down the equilibrium of strategies, strategies have to be specified at every node of decisions. There are two nodes $($1st, 3rd$)$ for player 1 and two nodes $($2nd, 4th$)$ for player 2. In a long version, $($Player 1 plays $D$ in her 1st node, Player 1 plays $D$ in her 2nd node; Player 2 plays $d$ in her 1st node, Player 2 plays $d$ in her 2nd node$)$ is the subgame perfect NE. In a short version, $(DD; dd)$ is the subgame perfect NE. Question 10: Ultimatum Game The ultimatum game is a game in economic experiments. The first player $($the proposer$)$ receives a sum of money and proposes a fair proposal $($ F - 5;5$)$ or unfair proposal $($ U - 8;2$)$. The second player $($the responder$)$ chooses to either accept $($ A $)$ or reject $($ R $)$ this proposal. If the second player accepts, the money is split according to the proposal. If the second player rejects, neither player receives any money. Find the subgame perfect Nash Equilibrium using backward induction. Solutions: Given the fair proposal, the second player choose to accept the proposal because $5 > 2$. Given the unfair proposal, the second player chooses to accept the proposal because $2 > 0$. Knowing this, the first palyer will choose $U$ over $F$ because $8>5$. To write down the equilibrium of strategies, strategies have to be specified at every node of decisions. There is one node for player 1 and two nodes for player 2. In a long version, $($Player 1 plays $U$; Player 2 plays $A$ if player 1 plays $F$, Player 2 plays $A$ if player 1 plays $U$ $)$ is the subgame perfect NE. In a short version, $(U; AA)$ is the subgame perfect NE. In Reality? According to this , \"When carried out between members of a shared social group $($e.g., a village, a tribe, a nation, humanity$)$ people offer \"fair\" $($i.e., 50:50$)$ splits, and offers of less than 30% are often rejected.\"","title":"Hw6 solutions"},{"location":"hw6_solutions/#homework-assignment-6","text":"Intermediate Microeconomics (Econ 100A) Kristian L\u00f3pez Vargas UCSC - Spring 2017 Due on Friday 9 June 2017 Homework assignments will be turned-in on paper, at the beginning of the corresponding lecture.

Check out the live demo . reveal.js comes with a broad range of features including nested slides , Markdown contents , PDF export , speaker notes and a JavaScript API . It's best viewed in a modern browser but fallbacks are available to make sure your presentation can still be viewed elsewhere. More reading: Installation : Step-by-step instructions for getting reveal.js running on your computer. Changelog : Up-to-date version history. Examples : Presentations created with reveal.js, add your own! Browser Support : Explanation of browser support and fallbacks. Online Editor Presentations are written using HTML or Markdown but there's also an online editor for those of you who prefer a graphical interface. Give it a try at http://slides.com . Instructions Markup Markup hierarchy needs to be <div class=\"reveal\"> <div class=\"slides\"> <section> where the <section> represents one slide and can be repeated indefinitely. If you place multiple <section> 's inside of another <section> they will be shown as vertical slides. The first of the vertical slides is the \"root\" of the others (at the top), and it will be included in the horizontal sequence. For example: <div class=\"reveal\"> <div class=\"slides\"> <section>Single Horizontal Slide</section> <section> <section>Vertical Slide 1</section> <section>Vertical Slide 2</section> </section> </div> </div> Markdown It's possible to write your slides using Markdown. To enable Markdown, add the data-markdown attribute to your <section> elements and wrap the contents in a <script type=\"text/template\"> like the example below. This is based on data-markdown from Paul Irish modified to use marked to support Github Flavoured Markdown . Sensitive to indentation (avoid mixing tabs and spaces) and line breaks (avoid consecutive breaks). <section data-markdown> <script type=\"text/template\"> ## Page title A paragraph with some text and a [link](http://hakim.se). </script> </section> External Markdown You can write your content as a separate file and have reveal.js load it at runtime. Note the separator arguments which determine how slides are delimited in the external file. The data-charset attribute is optional and specifies which charset to use when loading the external file. When used locally, this feature requires that reveal.js runs from a local web server . <section data-markdown=\"example.md\" data-separator=\"^\\n\\n\\n\" data-separator-vertical=\"^\\n\\n\" data-separator-notes=\"^Note:\" data-charset=\"iso-8859-15\"> </section> Element Attributes Special syntax (in html comment) is available for adding attributes to Markdown elements. This is useful for fragments, amongst other things. <section data-markdown> <script type=\"text/template\"> - Item 1 <!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"2\" --> - Item 2 <!-- .element: class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\" --> </script> </section> Slide Attributes Special syntax (in html comment) is available for adding attributes to the slide <section> elements generated by your Markdown. <section data-markdown> <script type=\"text/template\"> <!-- .slide: data-background=\"#ff0000\" --> Markdown content </script> </section> Configuration At the end of your page you need to initialize reveal by running the following code. Note that all config values are optional and will default as specified below. Reveal.initialize({ // Display controls in the bottom right corner controls: true, // Display a presentation progress bar progress: true, // Display the page number of the current slide slideNumber: false, // Push each slide change to the browser history history: false, // Enable keyboard shortcuts for navigation keyboard: true, // Enable the slide overview mode overview: true, // Vertical centering of slides center: true, // Enables touch navigation on devices with touch input touch: true, // Loop the presentation loop: false, // Change the presentation direction to be RTL rtl: false, // Turns fragments on and off globally fragments: true, // Flags if the presentation is running in an embedded mode, // i.e. contained within a limited portion of the screen embedded: false, // Flags if we should show a help overlay when the questionmark // key is pressed help: true, // Number of milliseconds between automatically proceeding to the // next slide, disabled when set to 0, this value can be overwritten // by using a data-autoslide attribute on your slides autoSlide: 0, // Stop auto-sliding after user input autoSlideStoppable: true, // Enable slide navigation via mouse wheel mouseWheel: false, // Hides the address bar on mobile devices hideAddressBar: true, // Opens links in an iframe preview overlay previewLinks: false, // Transition style transition: 'default', // none/fade/slide/convex/concave/zoom // Transition speed transitionSpeed: 'default', // default/fast/slow // Transition style for full page slide backgrounds backgroundTransition: 'default', // none/fade/slide/convex/concave/zoom // Number of slides away from the current that are visible viewDistance: 3, // Parallax background image parallaxBackgroundImage: '', // e.g. \"'https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/reveal-parallax-1.jpg'\" // Parallax background size parallaxBackgroundSize: '' // CSS syntax, e.g. \"2100px 900px\" }); The configuration can be updated after initialization using the configure method: // Turn autoSlide off Reveal.configure({ autoSlide: 0 }); // Start auto-sliding every 5s Reveal.configure({ autoSlide: 5000 }); Dependencies Reveal.js doesn't rely on any third party scripts to work but a few optional libraries are included by default. These libraries are loaded as dependencies in the order they appear, for example: Reveal.initialize({ dependencies: [ // Cross-browser shim that fully implements classList - https://github.com/eligrey/classList.js/ { src: 'lib/js/classList.js', condition: function() { return !document.body.classList; } }, // Interpret Markdown in <section> elements { src: 'plugin/markdown/marked.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, { src: 'plugin/markdown/markdown.js', condition: function() { return !!document.querySelector( '[data-markdown]' ); } }, // Syntax highlight for <code> elements { src: 'plugin/highlight/highlight.js', async: true, callback: function() { hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); } }, // Zoom in and out with Alt+click { src: 'plugin/zoom-js/zoom.js', async: true }, // Speaker notes { src: 'plugin/notes/notes.js', async: true }, // Remote control your reveal.js presentation using a touch device { src: 'plugin/remotes/remotes.js', async: true }, // MathJax { src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true } ] }); You can add your own extensions using the same syntax. The following properties are available for each dependency object: - src : Path to the script to load - async : [optional] Flags if the script should load after reveal.js has started, defaults to false - callback : [optional] Function to execute when the script has loaded - condition : [optional] Function which must return true for the script to be loaded Ready Event A 'ready' event is fired when reveal.js has loaded all non-async dependencies and is ready to start navigating. To check if reveal.js is already 'ready' you can call Reveal.isReady() . Reveal.addEventListener( 'ready', function( event ) { // event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv } ); Presentation Size All presentations have a normal size, that is the resolution at which they are authored. The framework will automatically scale presentations uniformly based on this size to ensure that everything fits on any given display or viewport. See below for a list of configuration options related to sizing, including default values: Reveal.initialize({ ... // The \"normal\" size of the presentation, aspect ratio will be preserved // when the presentation is scaled to fit different resolutions. Can be // specified using percentage units. width: 960, height: 700, // Factor of the display size that should remain empty around the content margin: 0.1, // Bounds for smallest/largest possible scale to apply to content minScale: 0.2, maxScale: 1.5 }); Auto-sliding Presentations can be configure to progress through slides automatically, without any user input. To enable this you will need to tell the framework how many milliseconds it should wait between slides: // Slide every five seconds Reveal.configure({ autoSlide: 5000 }); When this is turned on a control element will appear that enables users to pause and resume auto-sliding. Alternatively, sliding can be paused or resumed by pressing \u00bba\u00ab on the keyboard. Sliding is paused automatically as soon as the user starts navigating. You can disable these controls by specifying autoSlideStoppable: false in your reveal.js config. You can also override the slide duration for individual slides and fragments by using the data-autoslide attribute: <section data-autoslide=\"2000\"> <p>After 2 seconds the first fragment will be shown.</p> <p class=\"fragment\" data-autoslide=\"10000\">After 10 seconds the next fragment will be shown.</p> <p class=\"fragment\">Now, the fragment is displayed for 2 seconds before the next slide is shown.</p> </section> Whenever the auto-slide mode is resumed or paused the autoslideresumed and autoslidepaused events are fired. Keyboard Bindings If you're unhappy with any of the default keyboard bindings you can override them using the keyboard config option: Reveal.configure({ keyboard: { 13: 'next', // go to the next slide when the ENTER key is pressed 27: function() {}, // do something custom when ESC is pressed 32: null // don't do anything when SPACE is pressed (i.e. disable a reveal.js default binding) } }); Lazy Loading When working on presentation with a lot of media or iframe content it's important to load lazily. Lazy loading means that reveal.js will only load content for the few slides nearest to the current slide. The number of slides that are preloaded is determined by the viewDistance configuration option. To enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your \"src\" attributes to \"data-src\" as shown below. This is supported for image, video, audio and iframe elements. <section> <img data-src=\"image.png\"> <iframe data-src=\"http://slides.com\"></iframe> <video> <source data-src=\"video.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" /> <source data-src=\"video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" /> </video> </section> API The Reveal object exposes a JavaScript API for controlling navigation and reading state: // Navigation Reveal.slide( indexh, indexv, indexf ); Reveal.left(); Reveal.right(); Reveal.up(); Reveal.down(); Reveal.prev(); Reveal.next(); Reveal.prevFragment(); Reveal.nextFragment(); // Toggle presentation states, optionally pass true/false to force on/off Reveal.toggleOverview(); Reveal.togglePause(); Reveal.toggleAutoSlide(); // Change a config value at runtime Reveal.configure({ controls: true }); // Returns the present configuration options Reveal.getConfig(); // Fetch the current scale of the presentation Reveal.getScale(); // Retrieves the previous and current slide elements Reveal.getPreviousSlide(); Reveal.getCurrentSlide(); Reveal.getIndices(); // { h: 0, v: 0 } } Reveal.getProgress(); // 0-1 Reveal.getTotalSlides(); // State checks Reveal.isFirstSlide(); Reveal.isLastSlide(); Reveal.isOverview(); Reveal.isPaused(); Reveal.isAutoSliding(); Slide Changed Event An 'slidechanged' event is fired each time the slide is changed (regardless of state). The event object holds the index values of the current slide as well as a reference to the previous and current slide HTML nodes. Some libraries, like MathJax (see #226 ), get confused by the transforms and display states of slides. Often times, this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback. Reveal.addEventListener( 'slidechanged', function( event ) { // event.previousSlide, event.currentSlide, event.indexh, event.indexv } ); Presentation State The presentation's current state can be fetched by using the getState method. A state object contains all of the information required to put the presentation back as it was when getState was first called. Sort of like a snapshot. It's a simple object that can easily be stringified and persisted or sent over the wire. Reveal.slide( 1 ); // we're on slide 1 var state = Reveal.getState(); Reveal.slide( 3 ); // we're on slide 3 Reveal.setState( state ); // we're back on slide 1 Slide States If you set data-state=\"somestate\" on a slide <section> , \"somestate\" will be applied as a class on the document element when that slide is opened. This allows you to apply broad style changes to the page based on the active slide. Furthermore you can also listen to these changes in state via JavaScript: Reveal.addEventListener( 'somestate', function() { // TODO: Sprinkle magic }, false ); Slide Backgrounds Slides are contained within a limited portion of the screen by default to allow them to fit any display and scale uniformly. You can apply full page backgrounds outside of the slide area by adding a data-background attribute to your <section> elements. Four different types of backgrounds are supported: color, image, video and iframe. Below are a few examples. <section data-background=\"#ff0000\"> <h2>All CSS color formats are supported, like rgba() or hsl().</h2> </section> <section data-background=\"http://example.com/image.png\"> <h2>This slide will have a full-size background image.</h2> </section> <section data-background=\"http://example.com/image.png\" data-background-size=\"100px\" data-background-repeat=\"repeat\"> <h2>This background image will be sized to 100px and repeated.</h2> </section> <section data-background-video=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/site/homepage/v1/homepage-video-editor.mp4,https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.slid.es/site/homepage/v1/homepage-video-editor.webm\"> <h2>Video. Multiple sources can be defined using a comma separated list.</h2> </section> <section data-background-iframe=\"https://slides.com\"> <h2>Embeds a web page as a background. Note that the page won't be interactive.</h2> </section> Backgrounds transition using a fade animation by default. This can be changed to a linear sliding transition by passing backgroundTransition: 'slide' to the Reveal.initialize() call. Alternatively you can set data-background-transition on any section with a background to override that specific transition. Parallax Background If you want to use a parallax scrolling background, set the two following config properties when initializing reveal.js (the third one is optional). Reveal.initialize({ // Parallax background image parallaxBackgroundImage: '', // e.g. \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hakim-static/reveal-js/reveal-parallax-1.jpg\" // Parallax background size parallaxBackgroundSize: '', // CSS syntax, e.g. \"2100px 900px\" - currently only pixels are supported (don't use % or auto) // This slide transition gives best results: transition: 'slide' }); Make sure that the background size is much bigger than screen size to allow for some scrolling. View example . Slide Transitions The global presentation transition is set using the transition config value. You can override the global transition for a specific slide by using the data-transition attribute: <section data-transition=\"zoom\"> <h2>This slide will override the presentation transition and zoom!</h2> </section> <section data-transition-speed=\"fast\"> <h2>Choose from three transition speeds: default, fast or slow!</h2> </section> Note that this does not work with the page and cube transitions. Internal links It's easy to link between slides. The first example below targets the index of another slide whereas the second targets a slide with an ID attribute ( <section id=\"some-slide\"> ): <a href=\"#/2/2\">Link</a> <a href=\"#/some-slide\">Link</a> You can also add relative navigation links, similar to the built in reveal.js controls, by appending one of the following classes on any element. Note that each element is automatically given an enabled class when it's a valid navigation route based on the current slide. <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-left\"> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-right\"> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-up\"> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-down\"> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-prev\"> <!-- Previous vertical or horizontal slide --> <a href=\"#\" class=\"navigate-next\"> <!-- Next vertical or horizontal slide --> Fragments Fragments are used to highlight individual elements on a slide. Every element with the class fragment will be stepped through before moving on to the next slide. Here's an example: http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/fragments The default fragment style is to start out invisible and fade in. This style can be changed by appending a different class to the fragment: <section> <p class=\"fragment grow\">grow</p> <p class=\"fragment shrink\">shrink</p> <p class=\"fragment roll-in\">roll-in</p> <p class=\"fragment fade-out\">fade-out</p> <p class=\"fragment current-visible\">visible only once</p> <p class=\"fragment highlight-current-blue\">blue only once</p> <p class=\"fragment highlight-red\">highlight-red</p> <p class=\"fragment highlight-green\">highlight-green</p> <p class=\"fragment highlight-blue\">highlight-blue</p> </section> Multiple fragments can be applied to the same element sequentially by wrapping it, this will fade in the text on the first step and fade it back out on the second. <section> <span class=\"fragment fade-in\"> <span class=\"fragment fade-out\">I'll fade in, then out</span> </span> </section> The display order of fragments can be controlled using the data-fragment-index attribute. <section> <p class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"3\">Appears last</p> <p class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"1\">Appears first</p> <p class=\"fragment\" data-fragment-index=\"2\">Appears second</p> </section> Fragment events When a slide fragment is either shown or hidden reveal.js will dispatch an event. Some libraries, like MathJax (see #505), get confused by the initially hidden fragment elements. Often times this can be fixed by calling their update or render function from this callback. Reveal.addEventListener( 'fragmentshown', function( event ) { // event.fragment = the fragment DOM element } ); Reveal.addEventListener( 'fragmenthidden', function( event ) { // event.fragment = the fragment DOM element } ); Code syntax highlighting By default, Reveal is configured with highlight.js for code syntax highlighting. Below is an example with clojure code that will be syntax highlighted. When the data-trim attribute is present surrounding whitespace is automatically removed. <section> <pre><code data-trim> (def lazy-fib (concat [0 1] ((fn rfib [a b] (lazy-cons (+ a b) (rfib b (+ a b)))) 0 1))) </code></pre> </section> Slide number If you would like to display the page number of the current slide you can do so using the slideNumber configuration value. Reveal.configure({ slideNumber: true }); Overview mode Press \"Esc\" or \"o\" keys to toggle the overview mode on and off. While you're in this mode, you can still navigate between slides, as if you were at 1,000 feet above your presentation. The overview mode comes with a few API hooks: Reveal.addEventListener( 'overviewshown', function( event ) { /* ... */ } ); Reveal.addEventListener( 'overviewhidden', function( event ) { /* ... */ } ); // Toggle the overview mode programmatically Reveal.toggleOverview(); Fullscreen mode Just press \u00bbF\u00ab on your keyboard to show your presentation in fullscreen mode. Press the \u00bbESC\u00ab key to exit fullscreen mode. Embedded media Embedded HTML5 <video> / <audio> and YouTube iframes are automatically paused when you navigate away from a slide. This can be disabled by decorating your element with a data-ignore attribute. Add data-autoplay to your media element if you want it to automatically start playing when the slide is shown: <video data-autoplay src=\"http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4\"></video> Additionally the framework automatically pushes two post messages to all iframes, slide:start when the slide containing the iframe is made visible and slide:stop when it is hidden. Stretching elements Sometimes it's desirable to have an element, like an image or video, stretch to consume as much space as possible within a given slide. This can be done by adding the .stretch class to an element as seen below: <section> <h2>This video will use up the remaining space on the slide</h2> <video class=\"stretch\" src=\"http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4\"></video> </section> Limitations: - Only direct descendants of a slide section can be stretched - Only one descendant per slide section can be stretched postMessage API The framework has a built-in postMessage API that can be used when communicating with a presentation inside of another window. Here's an example showing how you'd make a reveal.js instance in the given window proceed to slide 2: <window>.postMessage( JSON.stringify({ method: 'slide', args: [ 2 ] }), '*' ); When reveal.js runs inside of an iframe it can optionally bubble all of its events to the parent. Bubbled events are stringified JSON with three fields: namespace, eventName and state. Here's how you subscribe to them from the parent window: window.addEventListener( 'message', function( event ) { var data = JSON.parse( event.data ); if( data.namespace === 'reveal' && data.eventName ='slidechanged' ) { // Slide changed, see data.state for slide number } } ); This cross-window messaging can be toggled on or off using configuration flags. Reveal.initialize({ ..., // Exposes the reveal.js API through window.postMessage postMessage: true, // Dispatches all reveal.js events to the parent window through postMessage postMessageEvents: false }); PDF Export Presentations can be exported to PDF via a special print stylesheet. This feature requires that you use Google Chrome . Here's an example of an exported presentation that's been uploaded to SlideShare: http://www.slideshare.net/hakimel/revealjs-300. Open your presentation with print-pdf included anywhere in the query string. This triggers the default index HTML to load the PDF print stylesheet ( css/print/pdf.css ). You can test this with lab.hakim.se/reveal-js?print-pdf . Open the in-browser print dialog (CMD+P). Change the Destination setting to Save as PDF . Change the Layout to Landscape . Change the Margins to None . Click Save . Theming The framework comes with a few different themes included: black: Black background, white text, blue links (default theme) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links (default theme for reveal.js < 3.0.0) beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin white text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Each theme is available as a separate stylesheet. To change theme you will need to replace black below with your desired theme name in index.html: <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"css/theme/black.css\" id=\"theme\"> If you want to add a theme of your own see the instructions here: /css/theme/README.md . Speaker Notes reveal.js comes with a speaker notes plugin which can be used to present per-slide notes in a separate browser window. The notes window also gives you a preview of the next upcoming slide so it may be helpful even if you haven't written any notes. Press the 's' key on your keyboard to open the notes window. Notes are defined by appending an <aside> element to a slide as seen below. You can add the data-markdown attribute to the aside element if you prefer writing notes using Markdown. When used locally, this feature requires that reveal.js runs from a local web server . <section> <h2>Some Slide</h2> <aside class=\"notes\"> Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard). </aside> </section> If you're using the external Markdown plugin, you can add notes with the help of a special delimiter: <section data-markdown=\"example.md\" data-separator=\"^\\n\\n\\n\" data-separator-vertical=\"^\\n\\n\" data-separator-notes=\"^Note:\"></section> # Title ## Sub-title Here is some content... Note: This will only display in the notes window. Server Side Speaker Notes In some cases it can be desirable to run notes on a separate device from the one you're presenting on. The Node.js-based notes plugin lets you do this using the same note definitions as its client side counterpart. Include the required scripts by adding the following dependencies: Reveal.initialize({ ... dependencies: [ { src: 'socket.io/socket.io.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true } ] }); Then: Install Node.js Run npm install Run node plugin/notes-server Multiplexing The multiplex plugin allows your audience to view the slides of the presentation you are controlling on their own phone, tablet or laptop. As the master presentation navigates the slides, all client presentations will update in real time. See a demo at http://revealjs.jit.su/ . The multiplex plugin needs the following 3 things to operate: Master presentation that has control Client presentations that follow the master Socket.io server to broadcast events from the master to the clients More details: Master presentation Served from a static file server accessible (preferably) only to the presenter. This need only be on your (the presenter's) computer. (It's safer to run the master presentation from your own computer, so if the venue's Internet goes down it doesn't stop the show.) An example would be to execute the following commands in the directory of your master presentation: npm install node-static static If you want to use the speaker notes plugin with your master presentation then make sure you have the speaker notes plugin configured correctly along with the configuration shown below, then execute node plugin/notes-server in the directory of your master presentation. The configuration below will cause it to connect to the socket.io server as a master, as well as launch your speaker-notes/static-file server. You can then access your master presentation at http://localhost:1947 Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... multiplex: { // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions. secret: '13652805320794272084', // Obtained from the socket.io server. Gives this (the master) control of the presentation id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // Obtained from socket.io server url: 'revealjs.jit.su:80' // Location of socket.io server }, // Don't forget to add the dependencies dependencies: [ { src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.16/socket.io.min.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/master.js', async: true }, // and if you want speaker notes { src: 'plugin/notes-server/client.js', async: true } // other dependencies... ] }); Client presentation Served from a publicly accessible static file server. Examples include: GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, Dreamhost, Akamai, etc. The more reliable, the better. Your audience can then access the client presentation via http://example.com/path/to/presentation/client/index.html , with the configuration below causing them to connect to the socket.io server as clients. Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... multiplex: { // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions. secret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server url: 'revealjs.jit.su:80' // Location of socket.io server }, // Don't forget to add the dependencies dependencies: [ { src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.16/socket.io.min.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true } // other dependencies... ] }); Socket.io server Server that receives the slideChanged events from the master presentation and broadcasts them out to the connected client presentations. This needs to be publicly accessible. You can run your own socket.io server with the commands: npm install node plugin/multiplex Or you use the socket.io server at http://revealjs.jit.su . You'll need to generate a unique secret and token pair for your master and client presentations. To do so, visit http://example.com/token , where http://example.com is the location of your socket.io server. Or if you're going to use the socket.io server at http://revealjs.jit.su , visit http://revealjs.jit.su/token . You are very welcome to point your presentations at the Socket.io server running at http://revealjs.jit.su , but availability and stability are not guaranteed. For anything mission critical I recommend you run your own server. It is simple to deploy to nodejitsu, heroku, your own environment, etc. socket.io server as file static server The socket.io server can play the role of static file server for your client presentation, as in the example at http://revealjs.jit.su . (Open http://revealjs.jit.su in two browsers. Navigate through the slides on one, and the other will update to match.) Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... multiplex: { // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions. secret: null, // null so the clients do not have control of the master presentation id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // id, obtained from socket.io server url: 'example.com:80' // Location of your socket.io server }, // Don't forget to add the dependencies dependencies: [ { src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.16/socket.io.min.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true } // other dependencies... ] It can also play the role of static file server for your master presentation and client presentations at the same time (as long as you don't want to use speaker notes). (Open http://revealjs.jit.su in two browsers. Navigate through the slides on one, and the other will update to match. Navigate through the slides on the second, and the first will update to match.) This is probably not desirable, because you don't want your audience to mess with your slides while you're presenting. ;) Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... multiplex: { // Example values. To generate your own, see the socket.io server instructions. secret: '13652805320794272084', // Obtained from the socket.io server. Gives this (the master) control of the presentation id: '1ea875674b17ca76', // Obtained from socket.io server url: 'example.com:80' // Location of your socket.io server }, // Don't forget to add the dependencies dependencies: [ { src: '//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/0.9.16/socket.io.min.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/master.js', async: true }, { src: 'plugin/multiplex/client.js', async: true } // other dependencies... ] }); Leap Motion The Leap Motion plugin lets you utilize your Leap Motion device to control basic navigation of your presentation. The gestures currently supported are: 1 to 2 fingers Pointer \u2014 Point to anything on screen. Move your finger past the device to expand the pointer. 1 hand + 3 or more fingers (left/right/up/down) Navigate through your slides. See config options to invert movements. 2 hands upwards Toggle the overview mode. Do it a second time to exit the overview. Config Options You can edit the following options: Property Default Description autoCenter true Center the pointer based on where you put your finger into the leap motions detection field. gestureDelay 500 How long to delay between gestures in milliseconds. naturalSwipe true Swipe as though you were touching a touch screen. Set to false to invert. pointerColor #00aaff The color of the pointer. pointerOpacity 0.7 The opacity of the pointer. pointerSize 15 The minimum height and width of the pointer. pointerTolerance 120 Bigger = slower pointer. Example configuration: Reveal.initialize({ // other options... leap: { naturalSwipe : false, // Invert swipe gestures pointerOpacity : 0.5, // Set pointer opacity to 0.5 pointerColor : '#d80000' // Red pointer }, dependencies: [ { src: 'plugin/leap/leap.js', async: true } ] }); MathJax If you want to display math equations in your presentation you can easily do so by including this plugin. The plugin is a very thin wrapper around the MathJax library. To use it you'll need to include it as a reveal.js dependency, find our more about dependencies here . The plugin defaults to using LaTeX but that can be adjusted through the math configuration object. Note that MathJax is loaded from a remote server. If you want to use it offline you'll need to download a copy of the library and adjust the mathjax configuration value. Below is an example of how the plugin can be configured. If you don't intend to change these values you do not need to include the math config object at all. Reveal.initialize({ // other options ... math: { mathjax: 'http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js', config: 'TeX-AMS_HTML-full' // See http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/config-files.html }, dependencies: [ { src: 'plugin/math/math.js', async: true } ] }); Read MathJax's documentation if you need HTTPS delivery or serving of specific versions for stability. Installation The basic setup is for authoring presentations only. The full setup gives you access to all reveal.js features and plugins such as speaker notes as well as the development tasks needed to make changes to the source. Basic setup The core of reveal.js is very easy to install. You'll simply need to download a copy of this repository and open the index.html file directly in your browser. Download the latest version of reveal.js from https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases Unzip and replace the example contents in index.html with your own Open index.html in a browser to view it Full setup Some reveal.js features, like external Markdown and speaker notes, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the reveal.js source code. Install Node.js Install Grunt Clone the reveal.js repository sh $ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git Navigate to the reveal.js folder sh $ cd reveal.js Install dependencies sh $ npm install Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes sh $ grunt serve Open http://localhost:8000 to view your presentation You can change the port by using grunt serve --port 8001 .
