<h2>Game Theory</h2>
<p>In competitive markets or in a monopoly there is no reason to think about any specific competitor.</p>
<p>BUT many other economic interactions do not have that core feature and agents do find themselves in interdependent / strategic interactions.</p>
<p>Interdependence (or strategic interdependence) means that my satisfaction or profit depends on my actions AND the actions of at least one other specific player. Therefore, I need to care for what s/he does or does not... I use a strategy.</p>
<p>A <strong>game</strong> is an interaction with strategic interdependence.</p>
</section>
<section id="types-of-games" class="slide level2">
<h2>Types of Games</h2>
<p>Timing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Static Games: Each player acts simultaneously, only once and has complete information about the payoff functions but imperfect information about rivals’ moves.</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic Games: Players act sequentially. Usually assumed that each player has perfect recall of what happened prior to his/her turn to decide.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Information:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Complete information (payoff function is common knowledge among all players) is different from</p></li>
<li><p>Perfect information (player knows full history of game up to the point he is about to move)</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="game-theory---static-simultaneous-move-games" class="slide level2">
<h2>Game Theory - Static, Simultaneous-Move Games</h2>
<p>Unless stated otherwise, we will assume we are in a &quot;one-shot&quot; (one round only) interaction.</p>
<p>Payoff's will be apparent to the players after the choices have been made (simultaneous game).</p>
<p>Typically, we use a <strong>payoff matrix</strong> that arranges all the possible outcomes a game can have.</p>
</section>
<section id="static-games---representation" class="slide level2">
<h2>Static Games - Representation</h2>
<ul>
<li>We use a payoff matrix when we have few strategies per player.</li>

</section>
<section id="best-response-correspondence" class="slide level2">
<h2>Best Response Correspondence</h2>
<p>The <strong>best response correspondence</strong> is the choice a player will make that will maximize her payoff, given the other players strategy.</p>
<p>If there is more than one optimal response; your best response will be all of the choices in the set.</p>
<p>See examples in document camera.</p>
</section>
<section id="dominant-strategy" class="slide level2">
<h2>Dominant Strategy</h2>
<p>A strategy $ s $ is a <strong>dominant strategy</strong> if it produces higher payoff than other strategies regardless of rivals’ strategies.</p>
<p>In other words, if a player has an optimal strategy irrespective of the other player's move, such a strategy is the &quot;dominant strategy&quot;.</p>
<p>See examples in document camera.</p>
<p>A strategy $ s' $ is a “dominated strategy” if for every strategy played by the opponent, there is another action the player can take and obtain higher payoff than with $ s' $.</p>
<p>If the best response set does not vary with what the opponent chooses and is unique, then the only strategy in the best response set is the dominant strategy.</p>
</section>
<section id="dominant-strategy-equilibrium" class="slide level2">
<h2>Dominant Strategy equilibrium</h2>
<p><strong>Dominant strategy equilibrium</strong> represents the combination of strategies that players in the game arrive at when everyone has used their own <em>dominant strategy</em>.</p>
<p>There can be a dominant strategy equilibrium only when all players have a dominant strategy.</p>

<section id="nash-equilibrium" class="slide level2">
<h2>Nash Equilibrium</h2>
<p>We say that a set of strategies in a game forms a <strong>Nash Equilibrium</strong> if:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Agents are MUTUALLY BEST RESPONDING to each other's played strategies. So no player has an incentive to deviate from what they are playing.</p></li>
<li><p>When all other players use in fact those strategies, one cannot obtain a higher playoff by choosing a different strategy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Cournot's equilibrium.</p>

<section id="mixed-strategies" class="slide level2">
<h2>Mixed Strategies</h2>
<p>So far, players have used pure strategies, which means that each player chooses a single action.</p>
<p>A mixed strategy is when a player chooses among possible actions probabilistically (flipping coins, tossing the dice, etc.)</p>
<p>A pure strategy assigns a probability of 1 to a single action, and zero to the other actions.</p>
<p>In a mixed strategy, more than one strategy receives a probability greater than zero.</p>

<p>Suppose $ b_c(r) $ is the best response for column player and $ b_r(c) $ is the best response for player row.</p>
<p><strong>Nash Equilibrium</strong> is the strategy profile ($ r^* $, $ c^* $) such that: $ c^* = b_c(r^*) ~~ $ and $ ~ r^* = b_r(c^*) $</p>
<p>N.E. in pure strategies: NE1: $ ~(r^* = Top $ , $ c^* = Left) ~$ and NE2: $ ~(r^* = Bottom$ , $ c^* = Right) ~$</p>

<h2>Best response curves - adding mixed Strategies</h2>
<p>Let's add mixed strategies to what we know about best response curves.</p>

<h2>Calculating Row's Expected Payoff</h2>
<p>Row's Expected Payoff becomes:</p>
<p>$ \pi_{row}(r,c) = 2rc+ (1-r)(1-c) = 2rc+1-r-c +rc = (3c - 1)r + (1- c) $</p>
<p>Row chooses $ r $ so the key term is $ (3c - 1) $</p>

<!-- $ \\Delta{\\pi_{row}(r,c)} = \\pi_{row}(r+\\Delta{r} ,c) - \\pi_{row}(r,c) =  (3c - 1)\\Delta{r} $ -->
<!-- When is this expression positive and when is it negative? -->

<h2>Sequential Games - Key concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In games where players move sequentially, we distinguish between an action and a strategy.</p></li>
<li><p>An <em>action</em> is a move that a player makes at a specified point (decision node).</p></li>
<li><p>A <em>strategy</em> is a <u> complete plan </u> that specifies the action a player will make based on information available at each decision node. (e.g, Entrant: Enters; Incumbent: Fight if Entrant Enters; Incumbent: Don't Fight if Entrant Stays Out;)</p></li>
